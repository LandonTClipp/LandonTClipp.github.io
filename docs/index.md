About Me
--------

My name is Landon Clipp and I am a software engineer who currently lives in Chicago, IL. I've worked in a number of different fields, including public research (mainly climatology), high frequency trading, and most recently in the public cloud building out high performance infrastructure for AI research.

I'm passionate about a number of things, and consequently this blog will dive into many various topics. The two most interesting sections of this website are my [Blog](blog/index.md) and also what I call my ["Professional" Notes](notes/index.md).


What is this Blog?
------------------

This blog is my dumping ground for every random thought, every interesting idea, and every useful thing I learn. It's not meant so much for others, but moreso as a tool for me to remember my experiences and to make sense of the million ideas that swirl around in my head. I wasn't born with an eidetic memory so my brain only has a certain amount of informational capacity. This blog, in a sense, is a cross-section of my mind at various points in time. Then again, isn't that true for all written word? By writing things down, I hope to enshrine things I've learned and to reinforce the pathways I want to encourage. The side-effect, I hope, is that you find it somehow useful as well :smile:
