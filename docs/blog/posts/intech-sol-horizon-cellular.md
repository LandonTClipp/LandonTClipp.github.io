Intech Sol Horizon Cellular Setup
==================================

In 2022, I bought myself an [Intech Sol Horizon Rover](https://intech.com/rv/models/sol/horizon/). I had been looking at RVs for a long time and decided on this particular manufacturer because of the excellent build quality and reputation of the manufacturer. The Horizon was a good fit for my needs because it was spacious enough to be comfortable for two adults to live in for long periods of time, and small enough that I could tow it with my Jeep Grand Cherokee. My goal for this RV is to be something that I could work remotely from, which means I needed to get a reliable internet setup. This post will show you my journey with finding the right internet solution, the lessons I learned, and the resources I used to make this a successful build.
