In a [previous blog post of mine](2023-06-21-intech-sol-horizon-cellular.md), I retrofitted my camper trailer with a cellular internet solution for remote work. After having over a year to gather data on the practical, real-world performance of the Peplink router, I've come to the realization that I am a huge nerd and want even more technology! In this post, I'll show you my journey with Starlink and my impressions with its usefulness as a remote-work solution.

## Background

You may be asking yourself whether Starlink is really _necessary_ for a remote working solution, to which I'm happy to proclaim a resounding _no_. I suppose I shouldn't be so dogmatic with that determination because it certainly depends on where exactly you plan on travelling. If you want to stay near civilization in any capacity, cellular internet at this point in 2024 is in almost all respects superior to anything else. It's not affected by weather (1) or trees, and it's available in nearly all locations that contain a small critical mass of people.

1. For the most part, obviously some cell towers rely on microwave relays to locations with real underground cables.

It didn't use to be this way. I remember the days when cell technology was atrocious, and getting access to a tower with decent throughput was a bit like winning a $2 lottery (and equally as satisfying. Kind of cool until you realize that you have to be glued to that one cell tower. Travel anywhere else and you're SOL). With advances in signal processing and increased bandwidth sales from the FCC, cell has come a long way.

Over the last year with my Peplink solution, I found that if I was ever near any small town, or any interstate at all, I almost always had access to decent cell coverage. In the instances where I didn't have good cell coverage, 90% of those situations wouldn't have been saved by Elon's solution due to tree coverage. So you may ask, why get Starlink? I already told you, I'm a technology nerd and I like to brag to people about how cool my remote work solution is.

Jokes aside, the real reason comes from the recent product improvements Starlink has made, namely:

1. Reduction in price of their antenna.
2. Full support for internet-in-motion.
3. Data plans tailored specifically to RVers. Their mobile plans offer unlimited data and the ability to pause and restart your plan at will. This is the killer feature that I was awaiting because being tied to inflexible billing schemes or plans that require stationary antennas were all non-starters.
4. Increased reliability with the ongoing additions to their constellation.
