title: Colorado San Juan Mountains
description: The last trip of 2025 to Colorado.
---

My last Colorado trip in 2025 was spent in the San Juan mountains of Colorado. So far, this is the most breathtaking area I've ever had the pleasure to visit and I hope to return soon!

A few months ago, I explored the south western part of the state for the first time. I went there by myself back in July, not knowing anything about the area, mostly as a blind journey to a place I had never been to before. This is in fact how I tend to do most of my traveling: a little bit of planning, and a lot of winging it. I'll sprinkle pictures of that trip with my second San Juan trip in this post.

## Buena Vista, CO

The first trip out to the San Juans started as a trip with my dad. We started from north western Indiana and spent 3 days getting to our destination. The first long-term stop was at a place called Buena Vista which is on the opposite side of Aspen in the Sawatch Range.

We camped in a spot called the Cottonwood Lake along a dispersed (and free!) campground. I took my dad to the end of the trail and we hiked up some minor trails towards the top of a fairly small mountain. Even this late into the summer, there were significant snow drifts that were easy to stick a leg through. This would be practice for the days ahead!

Surprising enough to me, I was told that Buena Vista held a spectacular 4th of July firework show. How in the world the fire marshals would allow such a thing confused me, especially with the persistent threat of wildfires in the area. Well, not my job I guess. We drove out into town and watch the show. Every 2 minutes or so, they had to stop the show and the fire marshals ran out into the grass to stomp out the bush fires LOL. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough to me!

Off into the distance was the imposing figure of a Colorado 14'er called Mount Princeton. I convinced my dad the day before that we should climb it. I watched the forboding demon from afar and told myself that we'd be at the top of that peak the next morning.

### Mount Princeton

I had done one other 14'er before and lots of 13'ers, so I felt pretty confident with myself. I was already acclimated to the altitude and in pretty good shape, but my dad was neither (sorry dad, it's the truth :D). I told him that when we're on the mountain, we don't _HAVE_ to make it to the top, and that even going halfway will be worth the view. There was no pressure to make it to the top.

We woke up early in the morning around 6am and drove about an hour to the trailhead. There are actually two different trailheads to choose from. You can either start from the radio towers, which is a much longer hike, or from the upper chalet, which requires a decent 4x4 vehicle to get to, but skips a lot of the monotonous forest roads. We opted for the chalet because we're not trying to impress anyone, and we're also not the most experienced moutaineers.

About an hour into the hike, the grass trail stops and everything becomes large boulders. I think they should rename the mountain to "Break Your Ankles Mountain" because if you aren't careful, you're in for some real hurt. The bouldering also adds a mental exhaustion component to it because you are _constantly_ pathfinding and making sure you step in the right place. To make it even worse, the trail is totally non-existent. The only way you can really tell where to go after a certain point is whether or not there's any moss on the rocks. We had to backtrack multiple times because we kept going the wrong direction.

We get to the first ridgeline (the last couple of pictures above) and we see the false summit above. More specifically, [this picture](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/landons-blog/assets/posts/2025-12-09-san-juan-mountains/IMG_7764+Large.jpeg) is a good representation of the imposing height of the mountain even halfway up. The summit shown in the picture is in fact the _false_ summit. The real summit can't be seen.

Despite all the trials we encountered, we made it to the top! My dad provided some great commentary in that video above. The AllTrails entry for this mountain was really misleading. It was way harder than I thought it was going to be mainly because of the bouldering required pretty much the entire way. I felt fine at the top, it was definitely hard but it felt like it was within my limits. We were certainly the slowest group on the mountain. 

When we started coming back down, the fatigue really started to hit me. I ran out of water and eventually had to start drinking some of my dad's water. We ran out _completely_ about halfway down. We were both getting pretty exhausted, but my dad was in far worse condition than me. We took it one step at a time and took plenty of breaks. I could feel myself getting dehydrated because I was getting headaches and my mouth was dry. I can't emphasize enough how HARD this was. But ya know, when you're faced with trials like this, there's only three ways to get off the mountain: with your own feet, with someone else's feet, or in a body bag. I thought using my own feet was the least dramatic way to get down.

## Aspen, CO

We drove over Independence Pass to Aspen for the next few days. The main priority there was to learn how to fly fish. We got a local guide to take us out to some of the best spots in the area. He taught us how to catch rainbow troute, which are a beautiful, multicolored fish that are about the size of your palm. Over the course of 2 days, I'd estimate we caught probably over 40 fish in total. It was a ton of fun, but also way more complex than I thought it would be. The act of fly fishing itself is not too terrible once you get the hang of it, but the knowledge you need to effectively select the right bait, the right areas, and the right times of day was fairly intimidating. I'm sure I could learn how to do it, but I also feel like I'd have to bear through a lot of frustration to get competent at it.

I can't say I enjoyed the town of Aspen itself very much. It's one of the most expensive mountain towns in the entire state (perhaps the entire country). Most everyone walking around town is dressed in polos and khakis, driving expensive cars, living in mega mansions... ya, it's not great. It was hard to find any place to eat that wasn't a Michelin Star, take-a-loan-from-your-401k kind of restaurant, and none of the working folk there seemed to enjoy being there. They certainly couldn't afford to be there. Our fly fishing guide was especially cynical and pessimistic about the town. The nature was phenomenal of course, but Aspen just left a bad taste in my mouth and I can't say I'm ever going to visit again.

## San Juans Visit #1

My dad flew out of Aspen to go back home and I was left to figure out what to do with the rest of my trip. I picked a random spot on the map on the south western part of the state, purposefully avoided any large ski towns like Telluride, and eventually decided to try this place called Silverton. I found a dispersed campground called Anvil Campground and spent the next week exploring the town and the various trails. The trail down Mineral Creek was a place called Ice Lake. I had no idea what was at the end, but everything I read about it online suggested it was well worth the effort.

The trail is pretty difficult for noobs but I did it without much of an issue. One teenager on the trail was laying flat on the ground vomiting his guts out because he was a fool and didn't prepare his body for the altitude. He had a small bottle of water, no backpack, no snacks, and had arrived from Texas the night before. So... he hadn't acclimated to the altitude and didn't really know how to prepare for a big hike like this. Yeah, don't do that. He also told me his buddies wanted to climb Capitol Peak the next day and I told him straight up he's in no condition to do that if he can't even do this trail! Where were his friends by the way? Oh, they abanonded him and continued up the mountain. What great friends you got there dude.

When I got to the top of the Ice Lake trail, holy smokes. That water was BLUE. This is one of the rare instances when I feel like the pictures above accurately represent how blue the water really was. I guess it makes sense, this water is entirely fresh snow melt. I walked around to the back of the lake and filtered the water into my bottle. The taste of that water was just incredible. Quite minerally, but incredible.

### Off Roading

I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk which is _nominally speaking_ an off roading vehicle. It has air bag suspension, full time transfer case, locking center diff, and electronic brake lock differentials. I also put some beefier Falken Wildpeak AT4W shoes on it, so it's "decent." There are a number of Jeep Badge of Honor trails you can take in this area. The easiest one is Ophir pass which can honestly be done in most stock SUVs. I'd even hazard to say many 2WD vehicles could do it if you're careful.

One of the more interesting trails is Imogene Pass. This is a much more difficult trail than Ophir Pass and requires more active route planning. The Jeep also handled this pretty well, but the lower air dam did get damaged and I was scraping the skid plate at various points.

### New Vehicle

I had been thinking of getting a proper truck for a long time. The Jeep could tow the trailer but it didn't feel stable and I was almost certainly overloading its payload capacity. You had to be careful when driving it. So I decided to buy a truck. You may have seen my [other blog post](2025-07-27-i-bought-a-truck.md). I drove to eastern Kansas to buy it from Main Street Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM of Lansing.

Sadly, the guy I bought the truck from Kyle passed away a few weeks after I bought it from a motorcycle accident. He was a really cool guy and my heart goes out to his family.

## San Juans Visit #2

My second trip was a few months later. This time I drove out by myself and went straight to Silverton. My friend Jeff was flying into the Durango airport to hang out with me for a few days.


### Ophir Pass and Random Trails

Armed with the experience I gained in my first San Juans trip, I took him on a very similar tour that I did the first time around. We started off by driving over Ophir Pass and down into the valley below. I showed him an awesome hiking trail just off the road towards the Ophir side of the pass.

### Imogene Pass

Aaaaand of course, here's Imogene Pass in the truck. This was actually the first time I did this trail in the truck, but I knew it was going to be much easier this time around because by all measurements, the truck is just better at off roading than my Grand Cherokee.

At the top of Imogene Pass is an abandoned mining encampment called Fort Peabody Historic Site that has some incredible, but horrific history. The signs below tell the story.

#### Old Mining Encampment

Fort Peabody overlooks a mining encampment that had tons of old equipment still lying around. The camp is situated on a high alpine lake, and you can even walk up into the two mine entrances (which have been effectively sealed off).

## Denver!

Jeff had to leave after a few days, and next on my roster for people coming to visit me in Colorado was my wife Kelly! The drive between Silverton and Denver is about 5 hours, and I also had to suffer through tons of I-70 congestion between Silverthorne and Denver. We stayed at a campground in the foothills called [Chief Hosa Campground](https://thedyrt.com/camping/colorado/chief-hosa-campground) which is near Evergreen. The main event (and the big reason why we were in Denver) was to see one of Kelly's favorite music artists Marina.

### Meowcat

The first place we went to is this... experience? Museum? Art exhibit? I don't really know how to describe it other than "all of the above." It's called Meowcat, and if you've never been to one of their locations, it's definitely worth a visit. I first learned about it when I went to a company offsite in Denver and thought it'd be a fun thing to do with the wife :D

Kelly and I also love to do ropes courses and zip lines, so we booked a zip line fun-venture.

We also got to see Buffalo Bill's resting site. They have a nice museum dedicated to him that teaches you a lot of his history. Kelly and I also got to pretend we were part of the show!

### Honorable Mentions

I didn't have many good pictures for these two things but they're still worth mentioning. We stopped at Phoenix Gold Mine at the recommendation of locals and saw a couple of their old mines (one of them had been a proper mine used in production, the other was just a prospecting mine). Phoenix Gold Mine is particularly fun because they have a HUGE population of resident chipmunks that you can feed. They're super friendly and I was even able to pick one up. 

Also, the Marina concert was a lot of fun. I was struggling to find the words to describe her, but eventually came across the description of "campy," which is very apt. Her music is campy and fun but with a fuck-the-haters-with-a-smile kind of vibe.

## San Juan Visit #3

I have done a LOT of driving this trip. Everything from San Juan Visit #2 to #3 was all a single visit to Colorado. I drove 30 hours to get to San Juans, then 5 hours to Denver, then 5 hours back to the San Juans, all for what? Well, because I'm kind of an idiot and didn't plan this properly, but also because I really really wanted everyone to see the San Juans. This time around, it's my mom coming to visit!

A big impetus for me doing these trips to get solitude, but this time around I got almost zero of that 😅. It doesn't matter though because it was tons of fun getting to share such a wonderful place with all the people I love. Solitude is great but there is no greater joy than getting to experience things _with_ people.

### Kendall Mountain

I took my mom up an off-roading trail that straddles Kendall Mountain. There's a number of abandoned mines, one of which was poorly sealed off enough that we could walk inside. It turned out to be a big nothing burger; the shafts only went maybe a hundred feet in one direction. These prospecting mines are littered all throughout the area.

### Old Hundred Gold Mine and Mayflower Mill

Silverton only very recently ceased all of its mining operations. The Mayflower Mill itself operated until 1945, but other mines in the area like the Sunnyside Mine operated until 1992. It's because of the recency of the Sunnyside Mine closure that many of the residents of Colorado, and especially the people staffing the mine and mills tours, legitimately worked these mines. Talking to them is fascinating because they recount how devastated the town felt when Sunnyside, their last operational mine, closed in the 90's. Far from being a death knell to the community, they succeeded in shifting their economy entirely to tourism. There's still a twinge of sadness in their voices when they talk about this time. Many come from multi-generation mining families, and to have that permanently taken away left them with a real loss of identity.

## The Shady Lady

![](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/landons-blog/assets/posts/2025-12-09-san-juan-mountains/Photo600797o.jpeg){ loading=lazy }

One of the old brothels in town is still in business today, although only offering the vice of alcohol. I didn't take any good pictures of the bar so I'm going to steal some online, credits at the end of this section. The building itself is haunted by the ladies who died there. The staff tell me that if you don't greet them at the beginning of the day and say goodbye at the end, they feel disrespected at the isolence and have been known to throw things at you. The staff say they're not malicious, they just prefer to be acknowledged and treated with respect. I'm sure they demanded the same from their customers as well.

## Silverton is Colorado's Coolest Town

I've been to many of the major tourist towns in the area. I've been to Ouray, Telluride, Silverton, and also outlier towns like Durango and Ridgeway. Without a doubt in my mind, Silverton is by far the coolest I've ever visited in Colorado. It's not pretentious by any means. The buildings are rough around the edges, there's no mansions in sight, I dare to say you might find a discarded needle or two, but the town has tons and tons of that old, raw, western outlaw character. The spirit of Silverton feels alive, and the town's dedication to preserving its old western styles and character is really extraordinary.

Ouray comes in a close second, but it's got a bit more of that pretentiousness I dislike. Not a lot mind you, but some. Silverton has none. You really do feel like you're a cowboy stepping back in time, and the original folks who live there, the mining folk, care a lot about the town's legacy. They care so much in fact that many of them are leaving.

### Silverton is a Victim of Its Success

There are two general kinds of people in Silverton. There are those who have lived there for decades. These are the old miners, their families, their children, people who have a real claim to the town. The other kind of people are what the locals deride as the "trust fund babies." These people, according to the locals, come from a whole lotta money and not a lot of respect. They told me that these people are being elected to positions of power in the township and are voting in ways that the OG locals feel is turning the town into just another Telluride, just another ski town. They tell me that people in the town used to know their neighbors. Nowadays, these rich millenians and older generations are moving in and destroying that sense of community. 

I spoke with the owner, an old lady, of Blair Street Emporium which is a cute little gift shop on Blair St. Her and her daughter both work the shop in the tourist months. The old lady has been trying to sell the shop for two years because she has been tired of the town for too long and was ready to be done. Her daughter felt a similar way. The daughter broke into tears telling me how the mayor of the town is showing a total lack of regard for the mining community that still lives there. She pointed to the town's unwillingness to maintain the [Christ of the Mines Shine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hm6U13PvJaEEg4uQA) which has deep historical roots to the community. She told me the people moving in don't care, they just want to extract whatever cultural resources they can out of the town and give nothing back. That is not how these towns have worked, and it's just turning into another souless ski destination.

My mom was right when she said there is a deep sense of sadness in the town. There's a sense of loss of what was and of what the town is turning into. There's also sadness that comes from the men who worked and died in the mines and the women who worked and died in the brothels. The people I talked to feel their community is being destroyed, that their home is no longer recognizable. This seems to be a common story that has been happening for decades that is by no means unique to Silverton. 

All I can say is that I left with a deep sense of respect for the town's history and for the people who worked and died in this area. Silverton's history is worth preserving and worth investing money into. Their historic society that manages the various museusm like the Mayflower Gold Mine and other assets in the area is struggling with money. Much of the old infrastructure is in dire need of repair and they don't have the funds to handle it. If I ever get stupid rich one day, I'd feel compelled to help them out.

I'll leave you with this video of the Durango & Silverton steam train hauling a load of tourists into town.
