Garbage Collector
------------------

https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide

Go is a garbage collected language. When a new variable is allocated (either with `make` or through literal declarations), the Go escape analyzer (which is run at compile time) determines if a particular variable should escape to the heap, or if it can remain on the stack. The garbage collector cleans heap-allocated data.

OOP (in Go)
-----------

The four pillars of OOP:

1. Polymorphism
2. Abstraction
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance

Go has all of the pillars except for 4. A common misconception is that Go's [type embedding](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#embedding) constitutes inheritance, but embedding is only syntatic sugar around composition. For example, an embedded type does not have access to the "children" structs. Thus, it doesn't have true inheritance.

Goroutines
-----------

A goroutine is essentially a "thread" of execution (not to be confused with an OS thread) that is managed by the Go runtime. goroutines are multiplexed and scheduled onto OS threads according to the needs of the goroutine. goroutines that are waiting on IO are put into a sleep state until they are ready to handle the IO.

Functional Options
-------------------

Functional Options are a style of specifying optional arguments. This is needed to get around the fact that Go does not have default parameter values. It works by creating a type that is defined as a function that takes, as its input, a config struct, and returns nothing. For example, `#!go type FuncOpt func(c *Config)`. Instances of this type will modify a config struct in various ways. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	name   string
	age    int
	height int
}

type PersonOpt func(p *Person)

func PersonName(name string) PersonOpt {
	return func(p *Person) {
		p.name = name
	}
}

func PersonAge(age int) PersonOpt {
	return func(p *Person) {
		p.age = age
	}
}

func PersonHeight(height int) PersonOpt {
	return func(p *Person) {
		p.height = height
	}
}

func NewPerson(opts ...PersonOpt) Person {
	person := Person{
		name:   "Landon",
		age:    2,
		height: 500,
	}

	for _, opt := range opts {
		opt(&person)
	}
	return person
}
func main() {
	person := NewPerson(PersonHeight(175))
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", person)
}
```
<div class="result">
```title=""
{name:Landon age:2 height:175}
```
</div>

### rune

A rune is an alias for `int32`. It represents a code point in the Unicode standard. The elements of a string (which are just singular bytes) can be converted to a rune through a simple `#!go rune(elem)` type conversion. It's important to know that some characters in the Unicode specification can be represented by different bytes. For example, Ã  can be represented in two ways: either it's explicit code point U+00E0, or through a sequence of two separate code points of U+0061 (which is the lowercase `a`) and U+0300 (which is the "combining" grave access point, which can be applied to any character). This form of character representation would require two elements in a string type in Go because it requires two bytes, but can be easily represented by a single rune.

### Channels

Receive

```go
foo := <-chanVar
```

Send

```go
chanVar <- 5
```

Channel directions

```go
func receiveOnly(chanVar <-chan int){}
func sendOnly(chanVar chan<- int){}
func sendOrReceive(chanVar chan int){}
```

### Maps

```go
mapVar := map[string]int{}
mapVar = make(map[string]int)
```

### Slices

https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro

Slices are a metadata view over a dynamically-sized array. A slice contains:

1. A reference to the underlying array
2. The length of our view in the underlying array (which serves as a boundary)
3. A capacity, which is the the number of elements between our pointer to the underlying array, and its end.

Slices are automatically expanded by the runtime when we run out of capacity. It does this by first allocating a new array that is twice the size of the original, then copies the contents of the new array. You can see this expansion behavior as such:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{}
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		s = append(s, i)
		fmt.Printf("length: %v capacity: %v\n", len(s), cap(s))
	}
}
```
<div class="result">
```title=""
length: 1 capacity: 1
length: 2 capacity: 2
length: 3 capacity: 4
length: 4 capacity: 4
length: 5 capacity: 8
length: 6 capacity: 8
length: 7 capacity: 8
length: 8 capacity: 8
length: 9 capacity: 16
length: 10 capacity: 16
length: 11 capacity: 16
length: 12 capacity: 16
...
```
</div>

When you allocate slices, you can specify the capacity of the underlying array:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := make([]int, 0, 100)
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		s = append(s, i)
		fmt.Printf("length: %v capacity: %v\n", len(s), cap(s))
	}
}
```
<div class="result">
```title=""
length: 1 capacity: 100
length: 2 capacity: 100
length: 3 capacity: 100
length: 4 capacity: 100
```
</div>
