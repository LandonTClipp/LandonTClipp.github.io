[Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20memoization%20or%20memoisation,the%20same%20inputs%20occur%20again.)
---------------

Memoization refers to caching the result of an expensive function call given a set of inputs.

[Optimal Substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure)
---------------------

Optimal Substructure is a term used to describe problems where the optimal solution can be found by finding the optimal solution to its subproblems. Greedy algorithms can be used to solve such problems if it can be proven by induction that the solution can be optimal at each step.

A Prefix Tree, or a trie, is a type of search tree used for locating specific keys from within a set. Each node of the trie represents a common prefix that all of its descendents contain. The name "trie" (pronounced try) comes from the word re**trie**val.

Each node stores a single character, and it has at most 26 children, one for each letter of the alphabet.
