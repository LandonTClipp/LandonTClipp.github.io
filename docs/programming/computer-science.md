[Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20memoization%20or%20memoisation,the%20same%20inputs%20occur%20again.)
---------------

Memoization refers to caching the result of an expensive function call given a set of inputs.

[Optimal Substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure)
---------------------

Optimal Substructure is a term used to describe problems where the optimal solution can be found by finding the optimal solution to its subproblems. Greedy algorithms can be used to solve such problems if it can be proven by induction that the solution can be optimal at each step.
