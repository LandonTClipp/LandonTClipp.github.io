[AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))
----

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a term used to describe a set of technologies that allow webpages to be dynamically modified without reloading the whole page. Modern usage of AJAX concepts tend to employ JSON instead of XML. AJAX is not a language, nor a framework, but a set of correlated ideas related to dynamic page rendering.
