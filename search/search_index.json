This post will help address the limitations of the default Amazon Machine Image (AMI) used in the managed compute environment.</p> <p>First, here is a nice picture of some clouds to get you in the right mindset:</p> <p></p> <p>According to the main page of Amazon's AWS Batch:</p> <p>AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install and manage batch computing software or server clusters that you use to run your jobs, allowing you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch plans, schedules, and executes your batch computing workloads across the full range of AWS compute services and features, such as Amazon EC2 and Spot Instances.</p> <p>For instance, say that you have a program that takes some input parameter <code>n</code> and gives you some result based on that number, but you want the ability to feed hundreds, perhaps thousands of different inputs into your program to compute the corresponding outputs. AWS Batch allows you to define this simple operation (for some <code>n</code>, compute the output) and will then take care of provisioning the necessary EC2 instances, cloud watch logs, error handling, and any other task necessary for you to run your workload.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2018/08/21/aws-batch-extended-amis/#the-problem","title":"The Problem","text":"<p>There are 4 primary steps that one must complete in order to run your first job on AWS Batch: 1. Define a compute environment. This includes selecting the IAM roles, your EC2 key pairs, the allowed EC2 instance types, networking configurations, autoscaling limits, etc. Essentially, you define the limits of your environment and what kind of hardware your VMs will be exposed to. 2. Define the job queue. Job queues act as the gatekeepers to your compute environments and decide which jobs to run and when based on the queues priority and hardware requirements. This is roughly analagous to a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster's various queues that one might see, such as high priority queues that will give their tenants presidence over the jobs residing in lower priority queues. 3. Define the job definition. This step is optional, but it is useful if you have a job that you know you will run with different parameters in the future. This is arguably the most challenging step because you must create a Docker image for your program and decide how you want to interface with your program through the Docker ecosystem. The job definition is where you declare how many virtual CPUs (vCPU) you need, how much memory, the wallclock limit (called the \"Execution Timeout\"), IAM roles, environment variables, and various other configurations.. 4. Submit your job to a specific queue using your job definition.</p> <p>Depending on the kind of program you are running, the amount of control that AWS Batch directly gives you over defining your compute environment might not be enough. I run an atmospheric science program called Basic Fusion (BF) that requires over 100GB of disk space, but when I tried to run it on AWS batch, I realized that the VMs that were automatically provisioned to me did not include a large enough disk volume. According to one of the official responses on the AWS developer forums, the default Amazon Machine Image (AMI) only provides 8GB of root storage and 22GB for Docker and metadata storage. </p> <p>The recommended solution by Jamie is to use an unmanaged compute environment. Unfortunately this ended up being poor advice because not only is creating your own unmanaged compute environment difficult and esoteric, and not only does it kind-of defeat the entire purpose of AWS batch, but there is a much better (and much simpler) solution. Jamie had also promised in various other threads a blog post that would describe how to fix this problem, but she was never heard from again.

This is because AWS Batch often places multiple container processes on the same EC2 instance if there is enough space. If you chose <code>Optimal</code> for your allowed instance type, this means that Batch could possibly choose some EC2 type capable of hosting dozens of container instances, thus splitting up your storage amongst all of them.</p> <p>The way that I get around this is by manually specifying which instances I allow so that I know exactly how Batch will partition the instance, as well as how many vCPUs and how much memory my jobs can request.

I wanted a setup where I could use my phone's internal hotspot for internet, as well as access to a directional antenna that will be powerful enough to punch through areas with incredibly weak signal. The Weboost Destination RV was a great choice because it required minimal setup and works seamlessly with all cellular devices that have their own internal antennas.</p> <p>Here is a general diagram of how it works:</p> <p></p> <p>An external antenna is mounted on a telescoping pole that you attach to the side of your RV using 3M tape. The antenna is connected to a signal repeater on the inside of the RV that boosts the signal to a higher dB. The repeater is then connected to a low-gain internal cellular antenna that your devices will interact with.</p> <p>The Destination RV works great with the Intech Sol Horizon because you can re-use the existing external coaxial port on the left side of the RV for running your cellular signal. This port runs behind the TV over the bed and is meant for routing a satellite antenna to the TV, but works perfectly well for a cellular signal as well.</p> <p></p> <p>You can then use simple 3M velcro tape to adhere the internal repeater box behind the TV and connect it to the coax port labelled <code>Satellite</code>. I strongly recommend using velcro 3M tape instead of permanently mounting with nails because you might find you need to readjust the positioning of your equipment. Connect the repeater to the AC plug using the provided AC adapter.</p> <p></p> <p>Obviously you'll want to clean up the wires like with a 3M cable hook or a coax staple. Once the repeater has been  mounted and connected, you need to find a place to put the internal antenna. Initially, I decided to place the antenna above the bed as seen here:</p> <p></p> <p>But I found this didn't work because the repeater box was flashing green and red which indicated that the internal and external antenna were getting to a runaway feedback loop condition, which caused the repeater to reduce the output power of the external antenna. This is a bit like putting a microphone up to its speaker. The feedback causes runaway noise and can only be fixed by reducing the volume (which is what happens when the repeater indicates a flashing red/green) or by moving the microphone away.</p> <p>I found that placing the antenna on the floor next to the bed was an easy option that didn't require any major cable routing. The feedback condition was removed and the signal as reported by my phone did indeed improve.</p> <p></p> <p>The bundled weBoost app is great for guiding you through the setup of pointing the antenna in the right direction and measuring the signal dB as reported by your phone.

I initially wanted the adhesive mount option but I realized that it comes with a large bolt on the bottom that you have to put directly over a hole. There is no way to have the cables run laterally along the roof, it has to go directly on top of a mounting hole.</p> <p>Instead, I went with the magnetic mount option, as the magnetic base gives the cables room to run laterally along the roof. MMH support recommended I adhere a galvanized steel sheet to the roof, which would give the magnetic mount the ferrous base it needs. Galvanized steel is resistant to rust and should last a very long time.</p> <p></p> <p>I applied a liberal amount of dicor self leveling sealant to the bottom of the sheet and stuck it to the roof. Dicor is not technically supposed to be used as an adhesive but I thought it should be fine since the sheet itself will not have to resist much upwards force. The better solution is to use 3M VHB but hindsight is 20/20 and all. I applied Dicor along the edges of sheet, ensuring that there were no gaps that water could intrude underneath the plate.</p> <p>A few months prior, I had solar experts install a solar panel system on the RV and they had pre-drilled a junction box to the roof. This enters into the microwave cavity and routes the power cables along a somewhat complicated path behind the fridge. All I need to do is route the antenna cables to this junction box and follow a similar path to the router.</p> <p>I used a 1\" hole saw to drill a hole into the junction box. I installed a 3/4\" cable glands that would serve as a water resistent entry point for the cables.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Cable glands are typically meant to only have a single cable passed through. Having multiple cables passing through weakens the water resistence of the hand-tightened seal. You might want to consider adding a small bit of expanding foam inside of the gland to make it truly watertight. I opted not to add the foam (yet), but I will be monitoring the box for any water intrusion during heavy rain. I will add expanding foam if I notice water intruding into the box.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/06/21/intech-sol-horizon-cellular-setup/#cable-routing","title":"Cable routing","text":"<p>Originally, I wanted to route the antenna cables across the dinette and into the righthand storage compartment like this:</p> <p></p> <p>However even with the longest cable option of the Parsec Husky antenna, there's not enough length to do this. So instead I decided I would mount the router next to the fuse box.</p> <p>Now that the cables were inside, the question now became how to route the cables from the microwave compartment into the electronic compartment just below. I asked the Intech Sol Horizon Facebook group about how they've previously done this. The best suggestion was that you can drill into the exterior shell of the shower surrounds. there is a fairly large gap between the interior shower surrounds fiberglass and the exterior, which is mainly where a lot of plumbing and electrical systems are routed through. If you take off the radio, you can see this more clearly:</p> <p>The factory-cut hole in the radio comparment is large enough that you can fit your whole arm in it, which should make it easy to fish the antenna cables through. I cut a 3/4\" hole and put the cables through that hole, then fished them into the radio compartment.</p> <p>I toyed around with how to place the router on the wall. I wanted it to be as close to the fuse box as possible to save space and eventually found the best place to drill another 3/4\" hole for the cables. After that, it's pretty easy to connect the cables to the router. Just make sure you follow MMH's directions on where to plug each cable.</p> <p>The Peplink router comes with a DC connection or you can plug it into the AC outlet. It's generally not recommended to use the AC outlet for electronics if it can be avoided because you incur a huge efficiency penalty when you invert the battery's DC into AC, just to convert it back to DC again at the wall outlet. Using a simple crimping tool and a ring connector, I attached the DC cable directly to the battery hubs.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The better solution for the DC connection is to attach it to the power cut off switch instead of directly to the battery. The Peplink router consumes energy even when not in use, so having the ability to quickly shut it off along with all the other electronics in your camper will save your battery.</p> <p>After drilling the router into the wall, plug in your SIM cards and the DC power connection.

Leveraging type safety in go allows it to inspect your program to determine whether an object can truly remain on the stack, or if it must be on the heap. </li> <li>Go makes conservative assumptions.

The alternative would be a program that handles garbage data, and even segfaults, due to unclear reasons.</li> <li>Because it's difficult to know at compile time whether the underlying type of an interface could cause a value to escape, the escape analyzer has to assume it's possible.

Other languages like Rust provide lifetime annotations that allow us compile-time guarantees that a reference will be valid at runtime. These annotations allow you to tell the compiler which lifetime a reference is attached to. Take for example this theoreical Go code:</p> example.go<pre><code>func yIfLongest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x &amp;'a *string, y &amp;'b *string) &amp;'b *string {\n    if len(*y) &gt; len(*x) {\n      return y\n    }\n    s := \"\"\n    return &amp;s\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is some complicated syntax, but those familiar with Rust might understand what's going on. Otherwise, bear with me. <code>func yIfLongest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;</code> is telling us that there are two separate lifetimes in our function, <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>. We assign <code>x</code> to the <code>'a</code> lifetime and <code>y</code> to the <code>'b</code> lifetime, and claim that the return value's lifetime should be the same as <code>y</code>. If the compiler has this information and already knows that <code>y</code> should never escape the stack, then it by extension knows that the return value also cannot escape the stack. Consider the alternative Go code without these annotations:</p> Go<pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    \"os\"\n)\n\nfunc yIfLongest(x, y *string) *string {\n    if len(*y) &gt; len(*x) {\n        return y\n    }\n    s := \"\"\n    return &amp;s\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    x := \"ab\"\n    y := \"abcde\"\n\n    result := yIfLongest(&amp;x, &amp;y)\n    os.Setenv(\"Y\", *result) //(1)!\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>./main.go:11:2: s escapes to heap:\n./main.go:11:2:   flow: ~r0 = &amp;s:\n./main.go:11:2:     from &amp;s (address-of) at ./main.go:12:9\n./main.go:11:2:     from return &amp;s (return) at ./main.go:12:2\n./main.go:7:20: parameter y leaks to ~r0 with derefs=0:\n./main.go:7:20:   flow: ~r0 = y:\n./main.go:7:20:     from return y (return) at ./main.go:9:3\n./main.go:7:17: x does not escape\n./main.go:7:20: leaking param: y to result ~r0 level=0\n./main.go:11:2: moved to heap: s\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>I'm not using <code>fmt.Print</code> here because we've already shown that it causes escapes. Setting an environment variable is an easy task that doesn't require the use of <code>reflect</code>.</li> </ol> <p>The escape analyzer is showing us that while the <code>y</code> argument does indeed leak out of the function because we're returning it in some logical flows, it never escapes because it inspects <code>main()</code> and sees there's no opportunity for it to escape. However, it does decide that <code>s</code> must escape because we're returning the address of a local variable.</p> <p>While go perfectly allows returning the address of local variables (due to the escape analysis and its garbage collector), a similar activity in Rust will greet you with an angry compiler<sup>2</sup>:</p> Rust<pre><code>fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n    let result = String::from(\"\");\n    result.as_str()\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>$ cargo run\n   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)\nerror[E0515]: cannot return reference to local variable `result`\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:11:5\n   |\n11 |     result.as_str()\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ returns a reference to data owned by the current function\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0515`.\nerror: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error\n</code></pre> <p>This is because Rust does not automatically allocate memory, while Go does. This is a tradeoff that Go has made for the benefit of a simpler developer experience. If Go were to adopt a lifetime annotation syntax, theoretically it could allow the compiler to make more informed decisions about whether or not a local variable needs to escape to the heap. If we're telling it that its lifetime is equal to <code>y</code>, then the compiler will decide based off of what <code>y</code>'s lifetime is doing. This could provide much more intelligence around the other more confusing behavior surrounding interfaces (and maybe even reflection). It could also enable the compiler to disallow any operations that would violate the lifetime we specified. This would reduce the flexibility granted by the garbage collector, but we could avoid its cost.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/07/15/analyzing-go-heap-escapes/#parting-thoughts","title":"Parting thoughts","text":"<p>I have seen lots of people grow upset about how even simple instructions like <code>fmt.Print</code> cause heap allocations. If you dive into the theoretical basis of Go and what it's trying to achieve, you begin to realize just how complicated it is to get reference lifetime decisions right if you don't have the proper syntax. Go's entire mantra is to make the grammar as simple and approachable as possible, which is likely why this sytax hasn't manifested. This has real benefits when it comes to developer productivity as instead of agonizing over the details of memory management, you simply write the code you want and the memory is handled for you.</p> <p>Go trades some amount of memory and CPU efficiency for the goal of developer friendliness. Its code is easy to read because debates about where memory should reside are deferred to the compiler, thus the syntax becomes minimalistic and free of memory-managing instructions. It is no doubt that languages like C, C++, or Rust will always beat Go in terms of latency, memory efficiency, and CPU efficiency.

You have to remember that the CDF itself is derived from a sorted list of edge weights in descending order. The compiler iterates over this sorted list and keeps track of the cumulative sum. It generates a cumulative percentage (which is quite literally what the CDF is) and compares that to the target threshold that we specified. If the CDF is greater than the threshold specified, it returns the edge weight of the node that caused us to go over the CDF threshold (which becomes the <code>hot-callsite-thres-from-CDF</code> value) and the list of nodes up to that point.</p> <p>If we specify a CDF threshold of 50%, but the largest node in our sorted list is, say, 90% of the CDF, then the only node that will be considered hot would be that single large node.

The CDF for such a scenaio is quite simple, since the probability of drawing any particular valued card is uniformly distributed at 1/13.

We're asking the question: \"given a certain percentage \\(p\\) (that being percentage of runtime), what is the edge weight threshold \\(F_h(p)\\) such that the sum of all edge weights at or above \\(F_h(p)\\) equals \\(p\\) percentage of the total program runtime?\" The answer \\(F_h(p)\\) is the <code>hot-callsite-thres-from-CDF</code> value we saw Go print out, and \\(p\\) is the <code>pgoinlinecdfthreshold</code> value we specified to the build process. We can mathematically describe our situation:</p> \\[ W = \\{w_0, w_1, ... w_n\\} \\] \\[ w_i \\gt w_{i+1} \\] <p>Where \\(W\\) is the set of all edge weights in a program, ordered by descending value. We first need to find the value of positive integer \\(m\\) such that the sum of the weights up to \\(m\\) is approximately \\(p\\). Why? Well because that's what the user is asking for when they specify <code>pgoinlinecdfthreshold</code>, they are asking the question \"what nodes do I need to select (ordered by weight) such that their cumulative weight is approximately equal to <code>pgoinlinecdfthreshold</code>?\"</p> <p>This can be represented as</p> \\[ m \\in \\mathbb{W} \\] \\[ F_h(W, p) = \\frac{W_m}{\\sum W} \\quad \\textrm{s.t.} \\quad \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{min(m)} W_i}{\\sum W} \\gt p \\] <p>We select the smallest possible value \\(m\\) that satisfies the inequality. I'm not sure if this is the most succinct way of describing this model but I'm not a mathemetician so you'll have to bear with me  In English, \\(F_h(W, p)\\) is the weight of the node at \\(W_m\\) divided by the sum of all weights, such that the sum of the nodes from \\(0\\) to \\(m\\), divided by the sum of all the weights, is greater than \\(p\\).</p> <p>You can see the Go PGO logic implements this function here.

For example, how do you handle argument types? If you decide to make expectations use the same type as the interface method, then how do you handle cases where you want to specify <code>mock.Anything</code> for one of the arguments (hint: you can't). Instead what mockery makes the <code>.EXPECT()</code> method arguments use <code>interface{}</code> so that you can specify <code>mock.Anything</code> (which is of type <code>string</code>), or a value of the type in your interface definition.

A human will make a request to some UI that specifies that we want to initiate a build for <code>v0.1.0</code> of our repo. This request goes to some \"backend\" (which we have not yet defined) that downloads the code, executes some build command (like some <code>build.sh</code> script that is defined in the repo itself), and uploads the artifact to some sort of repository.

Well, we could have an event driven system where new builds go into some pubsub topic, which also acts as a queue.

This is a good property to have as it means we can keep our workers maximally occupied and there is nothing inbetween the queue and the workers to slow the process down.</li> </ol> <p>Cons</p> <ol> <li>It becomes more difficult to determine what the current state of a build is. We'd need some sort of sidecar process that listens to the messages in the pubsub topic and keeps track of each build's state in a SQL database.</li> <li>It's difficult to create some sort of fairshare algorithm between the code repositories.

In this case, the database access should be protected behind some sort of arbiter process so that we don't have an unbounded number of workers trying to all perform complex tasks on the database, which would slow performance. It would also be unwise for the workers to directly access the database because then we're creating an implicit coupling between the database schema, and the schema the workers expect. If we isolate the schema access to a single process, it becomes more manageable to do backwards-incompatible migrations, should we ever need to.</p> <p>The worker itself will look like this:</p> <pre><code>flowchart\n    SQL[(SQL queue)]\n    dispatcher[[dispatcher]]\n    pubsub[(Pubsub)]\n    ArtifactRepository[(Artifact Repository)]\n\n    SQL &lt;--&gt;|determine next jobs| dispatcher\n    dispatcher --&gt;|message: job ready| pubsub\n    pubsub &lt;--&gt; worker1\n    pubsub &lt;--&gt; worker2\n    pubsub &lt;--&gt; worker3\n\n    worker1 --&gt; ArtifactRepository\n    worker2 --&gt; ArtifactRepository\n    worker3 --&gt; ArtifactRepository</code></pre> <p>The general flow looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>The dispatcher listens for <code>message: job submitted</code> from the pubsub queue, indicating we want a new build to be inserted into queue.</li> <li>Dispatcher adds job to SQL queue.</li> <li>Dispatcher selects next batch of jobs from SQL queue. This is determined based off of some priority tuple like <code>(creation_time,repo)</code> so that each repo can have individually-applied priorities. It sets the <code>STATUS</code> of these jobs to <code>PUBSUB SUBMITTED</code>.</li> <li>Dispatcher sends a message to pubsub indicating that the jobs should be processed.</li> <li>An arbitrary worker will receive the message and send a <code>message: job received</code> to the pubsub.</li> <li>The dispatcher will receive the <code>message: job received</code> and set the status of the job in SQL to <code>RUNNING</code>, and optionally note which worker took the job (useful for debugging purposes).</li> <li>The worker will perform the build. At the end, it uploads it to the artifact repository and sends a <code>message: job completed</code> to the pubsub.</li> <li>The dispatcher receives this message and sets the status of the job to <code>COMPLETED</code>.</li> </ol> <p>There is an important scenario to consider: what happens if the worker claims a job, but then dies halfway through the build process? We need some way to detect this failure scenario. One solution is that we could have the dispatcher periodically poll some HTTP endpoint exposed by the workers and check that it's healthy. Since we know which worker claimed a job, we can poll it to ensure it's healthy.</p> <p>If the poll times out, the dispatcher can set the status of the job to <code>FAILED</code> and prevent any other work in the job until it's explicitly retried. In the case that the poll comes back and the worker says it's working on some other job, AND the dispatcher has not seen either a <code>message: job failed</code> or <code>message: job completed</code> message, we can assume that the job got lost somewhere and set its status to <code>FAILED</code>.</p> <p>Pros</p> <ol> <li>The dispatcher provides us with explicit state tracking. It knows the status of every job and keeps track of its state.</li> <li>We still get the benefit of using event-driven message passing, which gives us a lot of room to scale.</li> <li>The dispatcher performs health checks on the workers so we can detect hard failure conditions.</li> <li>We have a lot of room to implement more sophisticated priority mechanisms, which can allow us to protect against a repo taking too much of the computing resources. For example, we could pop a maximum of 100 repos at a time, which allows us to do a sort of round-robin scheduling.</li> </ol> <p>Cons</p> <ol> <li>We're introducing a latency penalty, because there will be a period of time between when a job is enqueued in SQL, and when it gets submitted to the pubsub topic. </li> <li>The dispatcher might eventually become a bottleneck. Since it's a single process (which may be multithreaded), we're limited to the computing resources of a single node. We're also limited to how many operations we can do on the SQL database. However, since we're doing 1000s of deploys per day, it doesn't seem unreasonable for us to perform some single-digit multiple of SQL operations to keep track of that state. Plus, we can batch updates to the database, and make use of indicies, to improve performance.</li> <li>We have a single point of failure. If the dispatcher fails, then the entire process grinds to a halt. This could be mitigated if we introduce multiple dispatchers that have simultaneous access to the database. However this introduces another source of complexity in the system as we need to ensure there are no race conditions. Additionally, multiple dispatchers will introduce even more load on the SQL server, which possibly means more contention, so we'd need to be mindful of the load and SQL contention of our database.</li> </ol> <p>Overall, using an even-driven system with state tracking feels like the right compromise between latency and distributed state tracking. It allows us explicit prioritization logic between repos and can scale quite well to 1000s of operations per day.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/28/google-systems-design-interview-with-an-ex-googler/#artifact-deployment","title":"Artifact Deployment","text":"<p>The deployment mechanism needs to communicate to all production nodes what version of the application should be runnning.

Only after the replication succeeds can we deploy the artifact. This is a fairly complex solution because it relies on some blackbox replication system (which has unknown reliability/latency guarantees), and some external replication monitoring service. In my solution, my distribution mechanism relies on a single source of truth bucket and a series of tiered caching proxies. When we notify the servers that a new artifact is ready, they can immediately send a request to download these new artifacts. The caching proxies will initially miss back to the source of truth. After the initial miss, subsequent requests in a remote colo for the artifact will hit the proxy's internal cache, which will dramatically speed up the download.</p> <p>He also notes that it's unreasonable for all machines in a region to download directly from the GCS bucket, as that would introduce a ton of network overhead (and cost on the cloud side). He proposes that the machines in a region can participate in a P2P protocol so that they can share the artifacts amongst themselves. While this might work, it's an even greater source of complexity that can be operationally more difficult to manage. My solution of using a pool of caching proxies in each region is fairly simple and can be scaled horizontally quite well.</p> <p>It's possible, however, that we could use both the reverse caching proxy solution and a P2P solution down the line. For example, a server could first check if the file is available in the P2P network. If it's not, ask the caching proxy for the file (or, the caching proxy could be part of the P2P network! Interesting thought). This would give us some amount of redundancy because if the caching proxy pool goes down for whatever reason, the file is likely still available in the P2P network, which would allow the deployment to continue.

The first thing happening is that we're calling <code>self.subTest</code> which is a context manager that creates, you guessed it, a sub-test.

We format our <code>Params</code> dataclass into a python dictionary, then use the unpacking operator <code>**</code> to send the attributes of <code>Param</code> as individual keyword arguments. Take for example this failed test:</p> Text Only<pre><code>====================================== short test summary info ======================================\n(expected=PosixPath('haha'), path=PosixPath('/Users/landon/foobar'), root=None) SUBFAIL test_path_tdt.py::TestMakeRelative::test_make_relative - AssertionError: assert PosixPath('haha') == PosixPath('foobar')\n==================================== 1 failed, 9 passed in 0.05s ====================================\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>To get this output, you need to install the <code>pytest-subtest</code> plugin.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adding a new parameter doesn't require modifying every existing test case. We can simply provide a default in the dataclass and override this for any new test. Take for example:</p> Python<pre><code>class TestMakeRelative(TestCase): \n    def test_make_relative(self) -&gt; None:\n        @dataclasses.dataclass\n        class Params:\n            path: Path\n            expected: Path\n            root: Path | None = None\n            new_param: int = 0\n\n        for test in [\n            # ...\n            Params(\n                path=Path.home().joinpath(\"foobar\"), \n                root=None, \n                expected=Path(\"foobar\"), \n                new_param=1,\n            ),\n        ]:\n            with self.subTest(**dataclasses.asdict(test)):\n                assert test.expected == make_relative(path=test.path, root=test.root)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p><code>mypy</code> is able to properly detect incorrect value assignments.

Let's get one thing straight: Python does not have a decent parallelism story.

This is the source of all frustration and pain with parallelism in CPython, and it's probably never going to go away.</p> <p>For some context, in most programming languages you are able to create multiple threads of execution that are able to run simultaneously. The benefit of this, as opposed to multiprocessing, is that the threads can share memory, which means that your data structures don't have to be serialized over a communication channel (often a unix pipe or socket). This lends itself to a much more efficient style of parallelism because the shared datastructure has much better locality properties, and it's much easier to keep it internally consistent. This improves latency, it reduces complexity, and by extension makes your system more performant and robust.</p> <p>So what does Python do about this?

Both asyncio and Python's <code>threading</code> package can be used to implement concurrency. <code>asyncio</code> makes use of the idea of a \"coroutine\" which can be thought of as a thread-like concept, but instead of being maintained by the OS, a coroutine is managed by Python itself. Coroutines are not OS threads, but they behave in a similar way. (1) <code>asyncio</code> also makes use of special keywords like <code>await</code>, <code>async def</code>, <code>async for</code>, <code>async with</code> that are used to inform the interpreter on what functions are coroutines, and how to interact with those coroutines. This makes it easier to reason about where your concurrent code can block because you've explicitly defined it with the <code>await</code> and <code>async</code> keywords.</p> <ol> <li>Just without, you know, the ability to run multiple threads simultaneously. Coroutines can yield their execution when they're blocking on IO, but they cannot run CPU-bound tasks simultaneously. This is the distinction between concurrency and parallelism: concurrency means the threads of execution can yield when blocked by IO, thus allowing another coroutine to run. Parallelism means multiple threads can run simultaneously. Python does have parallelism through multi-processing, but multi-processing will never be as good as multi-threading because of its huge overhead, reduced memory sharing, and a need to maintain external channels of communication.</li> </ol> <p><code>threading</code> differs from <code>asyncio</code> in that it uses actual OS threads to multiplex operations. With <code>asyncio</code>, you can reasonably submit hundreds of thousands, even millions of coroutines, because a coroutine is an internal concept in memory, not an actual OS thread. It would not be responsible, however, to treat threads the same way. Go ahead and try, see what happens.</p> <p>If you're confused about the difference between <code>threading</code> and <code>asyncio</code> and <code>multiprocessing</code> and <code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, you're not alone. The glut of options at our disposal might lead a layman believe that parallelism in Python is flexible and well-conceived, but it's actually quite the opposite.

As you may already tell, shithon is basically just Python asyncio. Take for example this async function:</p> Python<pre><code>async def get_item_from_server(value: int) -&gt; int:\n    return await client.get(value)\n</code></pre> <p>The only way this function can be called is either in the context of another async function:</p> Python<pre><code>async def get_item() -&gt; int:\n    return await get_item_from_server(value=5)\n</code></pre> <p>Or if called from a synchronous function, through <code>asyncio</code>:</p> Python<pre><code>def get_item() -&gt; int:\n    return asyncio.run(get_item())\n</code></pre> <p>But wait! The asyncio docs say about <code>asyncio.run</code>: </p> <p>Quote</p> <p>This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.</p> <p>So what do we do if there is already an event loop running somewhere? Well, you can't. If your synchronous function calls async code, or otherwise adds an async function to the event loop, then by definition your function has to be <code>async</code> as well. Synchronous functions cannot call async functions if an event loop is already running in the same thread.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>I'm not going to go into detail the intricacies of asyncio, for one because it's just incredibly frustrating to me personally, and for two because it's already been well-documented in various places on the interwebz. Here are some good resources:</p> <ul> <li>https://bbc.github.io/cloudfit-public-docs/asyncio/asyncio-part-5.html</li> <li>https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html</li> <li>https://realpython.com/async-io-python/</li> </ul> <p>Going back to \"What Color Is Your Function\", the point can be distilled down to the fact that it's really hard to call <code>async</code> functions from non-<code>async</code> because considerations have to be made about whether or not an event loop is already running, and if it is, how you should structure your code in a way that allows you to call <code>async</code> functions. It bifurcates your world into two realms, so much so that crossing this boundary is super difficult.

If CPython didn't have a GIL and its internal data structures were thread-safe, true thread-based parallelism in Python would be a breeze and function coloring would thus become unnecessary. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/03/python-you-have-problems/#gils-are-bad","title":"GILs are bad","text":"<p>There are a number of notable examples of interpreted languages, or implementations of Python, that lack a GIL:</p> <ul> <li>IronPython</li> <li>IronRuby</li> <li>Jython</li> <li>Tcl</li> <li>Pike</li> </ul> <p>While this blog is taking a massive dump on Python, it should be noted that a lot of popular packages like pandas/numpy allow you to run data processing workloads outside of the interpreter in native C/C++, which means they are super fast and don't have the GIL limitation.

Go does not have true inheritence in its OOP model. It favors composition, which essentially means that instead of being able to inherit attributes and functionality, you create an attribute on your object that stores the dependency. This reduces the complexities involved with things like multiple inheritance and helps discourage needless abstractions. It's also quite telling how an entire diagraming language, UML, was created specifically to aid us in understanding inheritance models. Composition, on the other hand, shouldn't require diagramming because the object relationships can almost always be described in simple English.</p> <p>This is a whole blog post unto itself so I will not enumerate all my thoughts, but here are some suggested readings:</p> <ul> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance</li> <li>https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composition-vs-inheritance</li> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/05/03/python-you-have-problems/#parting-thoughts","title":"Parting Thoughts","text":"<p>Hopefully by this point, I've successfully enumerated my varying complaints with Python. And if you've made it this far, congratulations, you either totally agree with me, you learned something new, or you've become so miffed that you can't wait to leave a comment telling me how stupid my arguments are. In any scenario: well-done.</p> <p>Any time a huge amount of complexity is introduced into a system to solve some fundamental problem, that usually means that the foundational model on which that system depends is inherently flawed. In Python's case, package management, lack of strict typing, its GIL, its concurrency primitives, are all examples of things that are just foundationally bad. Their existence necessitates a huge amount of complexity in the Python ecosystem that should have, and could have, been solved by changing the underlying model, but for reasons that I totally understand, at this point in Python's life, doing such a thing would be totally infeasible. Just look at how painful the Python 2-&gt;3 conversion was, we're still dealing with the affects of it 16 years later!</p> <p>It is totally absurd to me how much talent is wasted in solving these kinds of problems. In my view, the only reason why these problems are worth solving at all is because Python's momentum is so great that asking people to use something else is often just not practical. If it had obtained less popularity, my reaction would be to totally abandon the language altogether because these issues are real dealbreakers from a reliability and time efficiency perspective. The proliferation of packaging tools, of the existence of asyncio and function coloring, the large number of different implementations of the language itself (I mean come on, seriously?), all point to the fact that what was given to us in the reference implementation of the language (obviously, CPython) is just simply inadequate. So much incredible talent, creating admittedly incredible solutions, has been spent working around what is fundamentally a big stinky pile of .</p> <p>It should also be noted that one of Python's main selling points is that it's so easy to use, so much so that it's often the first language developers learn. This is only a shallow marketing tactic because once you peel back the veil and see the man behind the curtain, you realize how unfriendly it becomes. This is in fact a common complaint amongst newcomers that the proliferation of tooling, and the lack of any real standard for just about anything, can make it difficult to become effective at the language in a professional environment.</p> <p>It's also my general stance that languages are simply a means to an end. My main priority is not being an expert in a specific language, but to be an expert in delivering business results. When I find myself fighting with and being confused at a tool, it either means I'm just too stupid to understand the tool (which very well may be true), or the tool itself is just inherently confusing. In either case, it's serving as an obstacle towards my end goal. I certainly don't think I'm too stupid to understand Python because I have indeed used it to create huge, production-grade, business-critical applications in a number of domains. It's just that I think the complexity I was required to wrangle is not justified by the benefits of what Python offers, especially in comparison to other modern languages today. </p> <p>I think it's great that some people really really love Python, so much so that they market themselves as Python experts Pythonistas. That expertise is clearly in high demand and I'm by no means attempting to diminish the importance of that, nor am I try to say that people are wrong for enjoying Python. My only stance, enumerated ad nausaem in this post, is that businesses need to think critically about these shortcomings before deciding they want to accept Python and all its baggage, especially when there are a number of better languages out there for backend-y kind of work (cough *Go* cough).</p> <ol> <li> <p>If I am somehow wrong about this, please let me know!

Why is there litter?\" She told me to pick it up, so I did and upon closer inspection, it was a message in a bottle! I uncorked that bad boy and tried pulling the paper out of it. During its short journey down the stream, it appeared that some water got in the bottle and made the parchment paper stick very strongly to the side of the bottle. Seriously, it was like it was glued!

That's where my  SUPER COOL  Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk comes in handy. Anyway, we get to the bottom of Signal Butte and start making the arduous trek up the hill/mountain/butte thing. And what a trek it was!  While I had already been in Colorado for a number of weeks before Kelly got here, I failed to make the calculation that Kelly will arrive only a couple days prior to this adventure and absolutely won't be acclimated to the altitude. And worse, I was asking her to hike up a very steep butte/hill thing so that I could propose to her and spend the rest of our lives together. Needless to say, she was struggling and I was worried I made a huge mistake in putting the last clue up on this hill. I was worried we were gonna have to turn around! Yikes! Nonetheless, Kelly was a trooper and she pushed through the thin air. At the top was awaiting her last clue, a ring!</p> <p>At the top of this butte/hill thing, I asked Kelly to be my wife. The 5 years we had been dating at this point solidified the truth that she is the woman for me. She is an amazing partner. She is a kind, thoughtful, loving, affectionate, passionate, caring, generous soul and has always strived to be the best partner that she can be in our relationship. All of the obstacles we encountered were overcome because of her willingness to work together (and my willingness too of course, but this section is about her dammit!). In fact, all successfull relationships require that. Relationships need both parties to set aside ego, to admit mistakes, to take measurable action towards correcting wrongs, and most importantly to give all the love one can muster to the other person, because they deserve it. That's what I feel has been the story of our relationship, a story of overcoming our personal demons and together nurturing a prosperous, loving, respectful, and FUN relationship.</p> <p>It's because of Kelly's fighting spirit that I have no question in my mind that she is a lifelong partner.

The pictures above are on Hwy 40 just before the pass, but sadly I couldn't take pictures of this area because it's an intense drive up an extremely steep, winding mountain road, and needless to say, I had to stay focused. Here's some street photos from Google:</p> <p>Of course these pictures don't really do it justice how steep and how high it felt to be on that road. Kelly's fear of heights was kicking in again </p> <p>We arrived at our campsite which was situated about 5 minutes away from the Grand Lake Entrance Station. The reason why this is important is because Rocky Mountain National Park can get very busy. So busy in fact that the park service implemented limited timed entry permits. Folks wishing to enter have to either buy timed entry tickets a month in advance of the reservation date, or the night before. They release only a limited number each time, so you have to be on your computer the very moment that the tickets are released.</p> <p>We didn't get them in advance so I had to log onto their website at 7PM and scramble to buy tickets. It was difficult because I would refresh the site and immediately select the ticket I wanted, but it kept saying \"sold out\". I would then try selecting tickets for the next time slot, and again, immediately sold out. I tried doing this for the 3 or 4 time slots they had available, and NONE of them could be reserved even though I was on the site at the exact moment they were released! Ugh! And it didn't help that their website seemed to be crashing from all the traffic.</p> <p>This was a pretty bad experience and I hated having to fight to get these dang tickets. I understand why the NPS does this and I don't fault them for it, they are just trying to stem the onslaught of tourists like us from flooding the park. Fortunately, timed tickets are only necessary after 9am, so you're allowed to enter the park before 9am. That's what we ended up doing, and surprisingly, there was no line and it was not an issue at all. No tickets needed after all!</p> <p>One REALLY interesting fact about this campground is that it sits right next to a tiny little creek. \"Aw, that's not that interesting .\" No no no, this is not just any tiny little creek. This is the Colorado River! This area is not far away from the Colorado River headwaters, so at this point it's only a tiny little stream, unassuming and nondescript.</p> <p>Kelly's highlights from this campsite were the duckies and chickens they had in this cage.

The other benefit is that it cuts out the Starlink-specific router which further aids in power efficiency.</p> <p>An example: https://www.amazon.com/XLTTYWL-Starlink-Protection-Conversion-Converter/dp/B0D4DH9TDN/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSWDXF0OT12S&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qP1_Af53E-CvdtPv7Z8Ofgdi-WmGsrNUh_pUqCU7mqM0kg8eZHiREHnkRnKASukvw53-zE8QEdZO6suABv0KcHQfiospY-KimIqMMPnpQbNk5K_vh80IUghh1iwSzbiQcKmUpalRPqlGA16_wXySqkvt3eF_s-pXVME5gYX7Z61T9Rgdj0WD-E69bUHeRGb-Nd1BDfqmMsqpqLw6JJXGCyLvUgLKZRXsSs1KrRBXsITz7TCcLh7Mjng6T_IEG8nM4wyL9_NQabBKBn7Mygp1wjrQd02OEE3Kvdvs1Af6LkE.vc0XT6Ve0TMX39b01i6X0JvnvOz-mPwDYB2KpDLSJfA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=starlink+gen+3+dc+conversion+kit&amp;qid=1728328253&amp;s=electronics&amp;sprefix=starlink+gen+3+dc+conversion+ki%2Celectronics%2C171&amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1</p> <p>For my proof-of-concept build, I will just use all the standard Starlink equipment and optimize it with a conversion kit at a later date.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/10/07/starlink-for-a-mobile-world/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>The setup was surprisingly simple.

Most notably, I had a separate install where I foolishly thought that using VHB tape to adhere the mount to the roof would be sufficient, but I was woefully wrong. It lasted most of my prior trip out west, but on the last leg of the trip, it was mysteriously absent from my roof. So somewhere out west, it's lying on the side of the road and hopefully didn't damage anyone's property. Yikes. After that incident, I decided to drill into the roof so that it was essentially impossible for it to happen again, and that is what you see here.</p> <p>At this point, I have no further ambitions to improve my mobile data setup. This is a behemoth of remote work. Consider the fact that I now have 2 independent cellular WANs along with Starlink: the Peplink router gives me the flexibility to efficiently switch between the WANs depending on the physical constraints of wherever I am. Furthermore, I could choose to use Peplink's Speed Fusion Cloud product that will multiplex the packets across all the WANs, arbitrate and reconstitute them in a cloud datacenter, and send it off to the final destination. Such technology gives you truly seamless and effortless failover in the case one or more of your WANs suffers a degredation.</p> <p>Speed Fusion Cloud does not receive as much attention as it deserves. It relies on a principle I grew familiar with during my time working as a backend engineer for a high frequency trading firm, i.e. duplicating packets across multiple paths and arbitrating them at the landing site. This was used to send packets between exchanges mainly through two routes: a fiber optic line (higher latency but reliable) and a microwave line (low latency but unreliable). This same principle is directly applicable to cellular and satellite WANs.</p> <p>Anyway, let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

Next on the agenda was to make my way to Crested Butte (pronounced byoot, as in like beee-yooot-iful. Yes I have to acknowledge to you children that it looks like Crested Butt). The plan was for me to drive from our campsite in Woodland Park 3.5 hours to Crested Butte. I left early enough in the morning that I should get there before dark.</p> <p>However, the gods had different plans for me. How arrogant of me to assume my trip would go without a hitch!

I swear to god this happened, I'm not making it up. As I got on the interstate, a MULE DEER was panicking on the highway because it was stuck in this 15 mile stretch of road that is flanked on both sides by fence. Of course I slowed down as fast as I could when I saw it, but as I was passing it at round 20 mph, it decided to RAM MY F-CKING tire while I was driving by. My thoughts uttered the word \"damn\" and I thought I would just go to the next town to look for damage instead of pulling over to the side of the road. Well 5 minutes after it rammed my tire, I felt the trailer pull to the right fairly firmly. Smoke was billowing from behind me as I looked in the mirror, so I was forced to stop and look at what's happening. This is what I saw:</p> <p></p> <p>I don't know if you can see right there in that there picture, but that's what's called a f-cked up tire. I didn't have many options. I could either call a tow truck, which I really really really didn't want to do, or try to install the spare tire. Installing the spare seemed easy enough, so that's what I did.</p> <p>I got the spare on just fine, but it was only at this moment did I realize that my electric tire pump wasn't capable of pumping to the spare's recommended PSI of 65. It could only go to 35 . Woohoo!</p> <p>I made a detour to Fairplay, CO which fortunately I was already familiar with and knew that there was a somewhat (or mostly) year-round campsite with full hookups. And they were still open for the season! I did some research and realized that ST (Special Trailer) rated tires, the kind that most trailers install, are actually shitty pieces of junk. ST tires are designed to have thicker sidewalls than normal car tires, but usually have less ply counts on the treads than normal car tires. This is done to stabilize the twisting motions that trailers experience. But overall, the construction tends to be worse because people don't usually care too much about their trailers, and they just want something cheap. These cool, beefy looking offroad tires you see on my trailer are in fact Rainier ST Apex tires. Their speed rating is 81mph and the max load of the two tires combined was 4800 lbs, only 600 lbs over the trailer's max gross weight of 4800 lbs. So, not only would the tire be damaged at anything over 80 mph, it didn't have a lot of leeway for payload (although yes, to be fair I would never load the trailer past 4000 lbs as that's patently dangerous).</p> <p>My research led me to the conclusion that for single-axle trailers, it's actually totally fine to put truck tires on them. So I bought two Falken Wildpeak A/T4W All Terrain LT235/75R15 116/113R E tires and had them shipped to the local tire shop.</p> <p>Here's the comparison of specs between the two:</p> Rainier ST Apex Falken Wildpeak Speed Rating 81 mph 106 mph Load Rating (Combined) 4840 lbs 5512 lbs Ply 6 10 Max Pressure 55 psi 80 psi <p>While I was waiting for the tires to arrive, I took a hike up Mt.

Parts of it were especially challenging because the trail was basically straight up with no switchbacks. It wasn't anywhere near as challenging as Mt.

Throughout my 5 years at the firm, I was exposed to a broad range of cutting edge technology and environments that propelled me to a competency that I feel college could never give. More so, I benefited from a number of close mentors who coached me out of bad habits and showed me grace when I needed it most. It also can't be denied that I regularly felt imposter syndrome because the sheer density of brainpower I was surrounded with was humbling.</p> <p>Sadly, all things end, and in late 2023 I decided my time at Jump was one of them. There was a broad (and noisy) kerfuffle that the crypto community experienced in 2022 that started with FTX and seemed to wind its way to a number of other coins and exchanges. The stock market also experienced headwinds with the post-COVID interest rate hikes and general market fear over the direction of the economy. These factors led to what I felt was a changing working environment that made it difficult for me to be successful in my role not just in terms of happiness, but also for the general trajectory of my career.</p> <p>Those two sentiments I just described, both respect and disaffection, might sound contradictory. I credit Jump for catapulting my career to where it is today and to the relative ease with which I'm able to navigate the job market. However, it's true that business realities can change on a dime, often through no fault of our own. The HFT community can be characterized as being really good when times are good, but really really bad when times are tough. To be clear, I have nothing but fondness for those I had the pleasure to work with, and there are many invaluable lessons I learned through the grace of my mentors and the compassion they showed me.</p> <p>Further, it's hard for me to not feel attached to my work. I think about my time at Jump a lot and of the many wonderful memories I have. I admit that I was dejected when I came to the realization that it was time for me to move on, but I'm glad I did because my new position at Lambda Labs is challenging me in the ways that I needed to be challenged.

That may be considered a charged term in today's political climate, but allow me to explain. There is a general principle in the US that it's considered to be rude, or impolite, or frowned-upon, or <code>[insert any negative adjective]</code> to talk about one's compensation. This sentiment is one propagated by none other than the very folks who have a vested interest in making sure you don't talk about it. Could you guess which class of society that is?</p> <p>It's no secret that HFT pays well. Like, really well. Fresh out of college, I was within the 99th percentile of earners for my age. In fact I was probably making more than what most college graduates make at big tech. This is compounded by the fact that Chicago, where Jump Trading's headquarters reside, can be considered in absolute terms to be a medium cost of living city. You can imagine that these factors led to a feeling that I \"made it\". I didn't worry about money. It was easy to come by, and the end-of-year bonuses endowed upon my savings an enormous boon. This is why I'm so adamant in the belief that if you can get a job in an HFT early in your career, you MUST seize the opportunity. You might even say that compounding interest demands you to do it.</p> <p>You, dear reader, also know that money is not everything. During my last few years at Jump, I struggled mightily between the pursuit of all things green and the less tangible ideals such as \"career growth\". What do I mean by that precisely? Well, it became a fact that through a series of personal and professional missteps that I cornered myself into a part of Jump that, while important to the business, didn't challenge me in the ways I needed to be challenged. I struggled to find the kinds of responsibilities I needed to assume to grow beyond the role of \"take JIRA ticket, write code for JIRA ticket, deploy code.\" It's possible this was more a function of what people trusted me to do, but regardless of the reason, I felt almost... bored? The kinds of responsibilities I needed involved cross-cutting concerns. I wanted the ability to create new initiatives, to play the politics game of getting people on your side, to be in the room when decisions are made. Instead I was relegated to only following. Intead of being a leader, I was in some ways a mindless zombie just doing what other people told me to do.

In short, this law gives Illinoisans the right to review their personal record from any employer. I submitted this request to Jump, and they returned to me an extremely comprehensive file that contained all of my end-of-year reviews where my colleagues enumerated in detail all of the ways that I had succeeded and fallen short.(1) Graciously, many of them were incredibly kind and generous in their appraisals of me (sometimes I feel unfairly so). But, I felt it was necessary for me to truly understand the ways I had been perceived, to let the sunlight bleach all sins.</p> <ol> <li>While these reviews were technically anonymous and had no names attached, I could usually estimate who had written them (sorry).</li> </ol> <p>What I learned from that experience was that while I was generally well-regarded in my technical ability, there were multiple complaints about the way I approached disagreements. Some of my reviewers in the early years noted that they grew so frustrated with my stubbornness that they stopped engaging with me altogether. Ouch! Clearly for any self-respecting engineer, your peers deciding that they'd rather disengage than collaborate with you is nothing short of a total failure on your part.</p> <p>While the personnel record highlighted some flaws I had to address, I also learned that people said many wonderful things about me and the quality of the work I generated.(1) I could perform the work, and exceptionally well, but I never found myself being granted the responsibilities and trust that I needed to truly stretch my professional skills. I found myself constantly embroiled in bike-shedy debates on technical direction, engineering decisions, and nit-picks that I felt were needlessly complicating my efforts to achieve my goals. I also didn't have the political wherewithal to ignore these distractions. I partially credit this with the dearth of trust that people felt in me. The other part can certainly be placed on other parties who may or may not have been dealing with their own demons, but elaborating on that wouldn't be of much use to the pursuit of  introspection .</p> <ol> <li>And yeah, of course I knew what people said about me to my face, which was almost always positive.

While my compensation was good in absolute terms, it was neither notable in HFT-relative terms, nor particularly exciting to me anymore. I found that in my pursuit of money, I had lost focus of the thing that carries you more than anything in life: relationships. I had squandered my relationships at Jump. I failed to foster them, I failed to nurture them. I thought that if I just work hard enough, churn out enough code, work enough hours, deliver enough JIRA tickets, that my compensation will follow. When I found that it didn't, that I was barely within the standard deviation of the mean, I was frustrated and deflated. Of course I was more myopic at that time and didn't realize that while it was true the business was suffering at that particular moment in time, I too had a hand to play in not being my best self to those around me.</p> <p>Of course I could get into a long rant on why I wasn't always my best self. This could turn into a long, complicated diatribe, but some of the main points were that I disliked Chicago, I disliked having to fight through crowded trains to sit in a chair only to barely talk to anyone, I was unhappy with the direction of my career, I was unhappy with the cultural environment I was in, I was dealing with personal issues at home, I was unhappy that I couldn't spend more time in nature (although my managers, to their credit, tried very hard to accommodate this need of mine, but I always felt I was asking for too much)... and so many other reasons.

Many people I respected in the company had been leaving with increasing frequency, so it wasn't just me. Regardless, it was time for me to unshackle myself from the fruitless pursuit of money and to approach my career from the proper perspective. The money, the trust, the status, the respect will follow once I put in the effort to cultivate those relationships, do good work, and constantly strive to stretch my technical knowhow, not the other way around. If there's one lesson to be learned, it's that your likability is a multiplicative factor to your technical proficiency.

Lambda, if you are unfamiliar, is a startup cloud company that sells infrastructure tailored towards AI research. Practically speaking, this means we're building out large, GPU-dense datacenters with large, expensive Infiniband and ethernet fabrics. It's not entirely unlike what trading firms do, but the HPC environments add another significant layer of complexity that comes with multi-tenancy requirements.</p> <p>Being a public cloud, we have to host customers in a virtualized environment. This means dealing with technologies like:</p> <ol> <li>QEMU</li> <li>SR-IOV</li> <li>NDFC (as an SDN)</li> <li>OVN+OVS</li> </ol> <p>And many other related services and technologies that go into securely hosting a public cloud with private customer data. It's been an exciting space to live and breathe because I'm in many cases one or two degrees of separation away from rubbing shoulders with the current AI titans of the industry. That's a bit of a vain observation to make, but I bring it up to highlight the excitement in which I find myself in.</p> <p>Another observation I've made is that AI has a real, tangible benefit to society. Many of our customers are generating models that can predict protein folds, examine CAT scans, generate videos and images, provide possible diagnoses to health issues, and lots of other incredible uses. In fact I have been increasingly using chatbots like ChatGPT to distill complex technical topics and ask it for inspiration on troubleshooting esoteric problems.(1)</p> <ol> <li>This deserves a whole blog post on its own, but I made the journey from extreme skepticism to whole-hearted believer when it comes to chatbots in the workplace. I don't view things like ChatGPT as a replacement for the human brain, but rather a more powerful alternative to Google and Stack Overflow. It still comes with the usual caveat of \"don't believe everything you see on the internet\" because it can be wrong in big ways!</li> </ol> <p>The cool thing about startups, especially ones with such meteoric growth, is that it's relatively easy to make a big impact. This is contrasted to larger companies (like Jump) that have a somewhat entrenched technical culture and already have \"the way\" of doing things.(1) In just a few short months, I was able to identify a huge business need that Lambda had around customer VM observability. Specifically, the need for us to ship customers metrics about their own VMs. Every public cloud deals with the same question and the solution usually looks something like:</p> <ol> <li>Install a metrics collection service on the VM.</li> <li>Ship the collected metrics to a hosted data store.</li> <li>Expose the data store through some kind of API gateway so customers can access it directly (either through a UI or API).</li> <li>Sell the metrics for profit!</li> </ol> <ol> <li>An entrenched technology culture by itself is not a bad thing because it often means that an organization has found a solution that works well enough. However it does mean finding ways to make company-wide impacts is sometimes a fruitless effort. In the worst cases, it means that the company has become so ossified that making dramatic business pivots is exceedingly difficult</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>I was able to identify this need both from comments that executive leadership would make, but also from customers lamenting the lack of this fairly basic product. This led to me leading a project that we call the lambda-guest-agent. It's simple in theory but in practice it's a quagmire that deals with topics like data privacy laws, security, SOC compliance, cross-team collaboration, priority management, and of course the fun technical aspects like metrics collection, Prometheus, public APIs, frontend graphing technologies, API gateways... you get the picture. Building a public cloud is HARD and even conceptually simple things tend to take enormous effort. This is very much contrasted to HFTs where concepts can be turned into production with relatively minimal fuss.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/12/03/2024-career-reflections/#building-a-cloud-from-scratch","title":"Building a Cloud From Scratch","text":"<p>Lambda's cloud is new. Originally, Lambda focused on building and selling desktops tailored to AI research.

This means that the requisite high-performance IB networks are a fairly different skillset to operate efficiently in a multi-tenant cloud environment.</li> <li>As it stands today, the AI cloud market is still significantly smaller than the traditional web services market, so the juggernauts don't appear to be super interested in this space yet.</li> <li>The juggernauts demand high price points, because they can. Lambda Labs is currently amongst the cheapest compared to other cloud vendors. Obviously there is still a risk that the juggernauts could play anti-competitive pricing practices and take intentional losses to drive away our market share, but this has yet to materialize in any meaningful way.</li> <li>AI-specific HPC systems are heavy, expensive, complex beasts by themselves. They are orders of magnitude more complex when you ask those systems to become multi-tenant. It takes a lot of support and a lot of time to get these systems operating efficiently, which means it's very human-capital intensive. The marginal costs of standing up more compute is higher than traditional web-focused environments. While the HPC community continues to iron out how to run AI-tailored, multi-tenant HPC systems, the ongoing costs will remain elevated as well. Lambda is time-advantaged in this case because we are learning these lessons now, while the big cloud vendors appear to be sleeping at the wheel.</li> </ol> <p>Currently, Lambda's focus is on tailoring our experience for the small AI developers. Our strategy is to court small AI startups through solid support experiences, reliable infrastructure, reasonable price points, and good experiences so that if/when the startup becomes larger, they continue to do business with us.</p> <p>Our main competitor in this space, Coreweave, only focuses on landing a small number of mega-sized contracts. This presents a large business risk with the possibility that some of their customers decide not to renew. Lambda's approach is to spread our customer base amongst a large number of smaller customers and to wage an effective marketing campaign to prove to AI researchers that our product is better than the competition. It also incentivizes us to solve the multi-tenant AI-HPC infrastructure problem better than anyone else so that we are better positioned than anyone else to support AI research into the future.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/12/03/2024-career-reflections/#looking-forward","title":"Looking Forward","text":"<p>Where do I go from here?

The incentives back then were to drive user growth by creating a product people actually enjoyed using. Financial motivations were somewhat secondary because most of these companies were startups and hadn't yet become completely beholden to the whims of Wall St. This is also a period of time when advertisements weren't so invasive, specific, and targeted, so there was less of a sense that you were under constant surveillance by the all-mighty unseen eye of The Algorithm<sup>TM</sup>.</p> <p>The internet was fun back then. It was a real cultural moment where social media, things like Myspace, The YouTube, The Facebook, felt like places to go for authentic connection with your friends. They were cool and fun and, more importantly, they created a sort of cultural epicenter that young folks used as a way to relate to one another. The internet was most certainly the wild west in some respects, but it didn't feel entirely dangerous or that there was a nefarious agenda behind it. Teenagers still went out with their friends, we still had physical spaces, we weren't glued to our phones (mostly because phones just sucked to use back then), and there wasn't a sense that internet addiction was a thing.

Forums at the time did not really consist of one monolithic meta-forum like Reddit.

One in particular that I took a liking to was the bungie.net forum where Halo gamers like myself would congregate to talk about Halo mostly, but also really about anything in life. It felt like a real community: I saw the same people, I knew the different personalities, I knew people's life stories, and I played with them in the game. There was a real attachment because the community felt real and genuine.</p> <p></p> <p>The off-topic part of the forum was affectionately called The Flood, named after a race of parasites in Halo that endangered all life in the galaxy, and of which served as the primary antagonist in the game's story. The purpose of the \"sub-forum\" was to \"Surf a Flood of random discussion.\" I don't know why I gravitated towards this forum in particular. Perhaps it was relevant enough to my love of Halo, but I think it was more about the fact that there was a vibrant community of like-minded folks that I felt a connection to.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/14/on-blogs-and-social-media/#change","title":"Change","text":"<p>The internet began to change around the mid 2010's. It was this period where social media companies became better at harvesting user data to mine specific details about their users. Using Big Data<sup>TM</sup> technologies (one of the buzz-words at the time that is now considered to just be a standard concept that all software engineers are expected to be familiar with), companies created profiles for users that included information like:</p> <ol> <li>Your race</li> <li>Where you were born</li> <li>Where you live</li> <li>Your hobbies</li> <li>Your work</li> <li>Who you're married to</li> <li>Who your exes are</li> <li>People you were in close proximity to</li> <li>Your likes</li> <li>Your dislikes</li> <li>Your shopping preferences</li> <li>Your fears</li> <li>Your hopes</li> </ol> <p>By itself, these kinds of parameters can be used to create effective advertisement campaigns. People who have shown propensities to buy designer shoes will be shown more ads for designer shoes. This means that companies with larger, more specific user data can charge more for showing ads on their platforms because the ads will be more effective at generating new customers.</p> <p>On the surface this might sound like a good thing: you'll only see ads for things that might actually interest you. The more sinister effect of this is that it creates an incentive for social media companies to uncover even more information about you, to learn things about you that maybe you weren't even aware of, and to even predict what you might want in the future! How do companies predict what you might want? Well, because they have this large dataset on all of their users, they can run algorithms that can study networking effects. Meaning, your closest friends have shown interest in this thing, so maybe you'll want to see ads about it as well?</p> <p>This has led to some really creepy effects. I have memories in college where I was talking in-person with someone about a really specific, esoteric topic. I didn't know this person, I had no direct affiliations with them, I had never searched for this topic before (and I didn't search about it after), but the morning after I was talking with this person about this thing, I started receiving tons of ads for that specific thing.

It was creepy because it felt like I was being surveilled.</p> <p>The model for how this worked likely had less to do with my phone listening to us talk, but more along the lines that this person probably searched Google for this topic after we chatted, the internet knew we were in the same place at the same time, and it also probably knew that we had some mutual friends in common.

How do you do that? Well, by making your platform addictive, of course. Behavioral analysts at places like Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Snapchat etc. learned that the strongest emotions in humans is anger and hate. When people feel angry, they feel motivated to act. If people feel motivated to act, you can direct that motivation to translate to more time on your particular app. So, unsurprisingly, this is exactly what social media companies started doing. They tuned their algorithms to optimize for user engagement, and whether on purpose or not, the ideas and posts and videos that elicited anger also elicited the most engagement. And remember what more engagement means? More money from advertisers.</p> <p>Social media companies turned into anger machines. The more incensed, outraged, angry, antagonized people felt, the more money these platforms received. This began to wind its way into the political sphere. Both liberals and conservatives alike fell prey to these schemes and they became outraged at every little thing, whether it's gender-neutral bathrooms, someone on a college campus acting like a fool, immigrants coming across the border to steal your jobs... all of society's problems became amplified and made to seem like larger issues than they actually were.

The real turning point for me in my views on social media came during the Trump era. What I saw was this politician who had a real loose relationship with the truth, and he would say basically anything he could to reflect and amplify the hate and anger that people were already feeling. He consistently, brutally, effectively, and pathologically spread complete falsities with the sole purpose of making people feel like he related to their frustrations. The truth did not matter to him. What mattered to him was gaining power, and an effective way to do that, like with any ruler in history, is to fan the flames of anxiety while simultaneously proclaiming to be the singular proprietor of the solution.</p> <p>Whatever your views on Trump, it's hard to deny when you step back and really examine many of the claims he makes, that his remarks rarely have anything to do with truth. It mostly has to do with gut feelings and vibes. He's effective at touching on the many legitimate anxieties people have (things like worsening economic inequalities, worse opportunities, worse affordability of essential things like housing and food), which makes his constituents feel like he actually cares about their struggles. And that feeling translates into votes.</p> <p>What I saw leading up to the 2020 election was that many of my close friends and family, many of whom had never shown a propensity or interest in politics, began performing what I can only describe as unmitigated worship of Trump. One friend in particular even had a whole shrine dedicated to him that contained a $100 bill with Trump's face in the middle, the Art of the Deal, a MAGA hat, a Trump bobble head, pictures, paraphernalia, swag, whatever you can think of. This friend who I knew for my whole life as a good person began spouting pretty hateful things, I guess because Trump made it feel acceptable to do this.</p> <p>This dramatic shift was troubling to me. I never saw politicians as people to be worshipped. In my mind, we should be eternally skeptical of them and hold them accountable when they go against our best nature as fellow humans. It really angered me how so many of my lifelong friends and family fell headlong into this cult of personality. It angered me how so many of these people I loved were spouting hateful, vengeful, gross, disgusting things. It confused me how so many people that I knew in my heart as good people could believe such awful things about our fellow human and our fellow US citizens. Our political landscape turned from a somewhat mutually respectful arena to something like the Mad Max Thunderdome where the only goal was to vilify and destroy your competition.</p> <p>I shamefully admit that I lost many good relationships because I could not reconcile what I historically knew about these people with the toxic and hateful things they were saying and doing. It was difficult for me to be around them because I saw them as worshipping someone who was the antithesis of everything I value in life. And if that's who they admire and respect, what does that say about them as people?</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/14/on-blogs-and-social-media/#the-worst-time-for-social-media","title":"The Worst Time for Social Media","text":"<p>Damn, I didn't expect this to become such a diatribe, but it's something I feel passionate about. Let's bring back the discussion back to home base.</p> <p>I've reflected a lot on the woeful state of our politics and I've realized that where we find ourselves today can all be traced back to social media. The toxicity of our politics started to really become the norm around the same time that Facebook came onto the scene, around the time that Big Data<sup>TM</sup> engineering practices allowed mass surveillance of the population. This is when I started to really retract from the social media space because it turned from this thing that allowed me to spread joy with my family and friends to something where I only saw hate from the people I love. This was truly the worst time for social media. Young kids are getting addicted to their phones, friends and family are spouting hateful nonsense, and any sense of genuine connection has been replaced by mass surveillance and targeted ad campaigns. What's the point anymore? We have reached the end state of the capitalist goal and there is no value left for me.

My general goal after the Trump era was to disengage from the turmoil. I didn't want to see ads, I didn't want to see hateful content, I didn't want to hear about the shitty political opinions of everyone around me. I wanted to go back to the golden age of the internet, the era where the internet worked for the people and not for the capitalists. I wanted a space to think clearly, to share the things I care about, and to not have my data farmed so some rich gentleman can get even richer. I wanted long-form content where people formulate real ideas that make me think.</p> <p>I initially made this site as just a public dumping ground for all the technical topics I deal with in my profession. I wanted my notes to be publicly visible so I could easily share it with folks, and I wanted it to be available anywhere without needing to log into anything to view it (which I guess means \"publicly visible\" ). Notes, of course, are just generally good to maintain, but they're even more effective when you can share them with people. They are maximally effective when your notes have good searchability, which means the content is indexed and you can quickly find the topics you care about.</p> <p>I began writing a few blog posts about some personal topics I care about, things like camping, my open source projects, some technical concepts, and I quickly found that it's actually fun as shit to go into deep dives on whatever I find interesting at the time and share it with people. Some of my posts on technical topics have been referenced in the Blogosphere many times, and a few people have even gone so far as to consider my thoughts as somewhat authoritative! </p> <p>These thoughts of mine are mine alone, and no social media site deserves to host them. That might be an uninteresting revelation, and many of you probably came to this conclusion a long time ago. So that's where I land myself today; this blog isn't so much for other people as it is for me to organize my own thoughts, to document how my thinking evolves over time, and to provide a safe way for anyone I care about to interact with me (either silently or explicitly) without being concerned about that communication being harvested for a capitalistic agenda.</p> <p>I still find myself longing for the period of the Decade-Long Party, the golden era of the internet. I'm not sure we can ever truly return to that, but me disengaging from social media in all forms is one step towards that direction. Even if it's my own lonely corner of the internet that no one ever visits, at least I'll have peace from whatever kind of soul-sucking monstrosity the internet has become.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/14/on-blogs-and-social-media/#a-fun-chatgpt-allegory","title":"A Fun ChatGPT Allegory","text":"<p>I asked ChatGPT to make an allegory of the post above and it's kinda neat what it came up with :D </p> <p>I know I know, it's kinda cringe, but it's interesting the kinds of things it comes up with.</p> The Kingdom of Ember Vale <p>Once, there was a vast and thriving kingdom called Ember Vale, nestled between mountains of wisdom and rivers of shared trust. Its people, though diverse in thought and creed, lived in relative harmony. They debated ideas openly in the Great Commons, a space where disagreements were the sparks that forged understanding, not flames that consumed it.</p> <p>But one day, a shadow fell over Ember Vale. An ambitious group of merchants arrived, bearing glittering trinkets they claimed could reveal \u201ctruths\u201d faster than the human heart could feel or the mind could reason. They called their invention The Echo Spire. It stood tall in the center of the kingdom, a tower of shifting mirrors that reflected back the desires, fears, and anger of those who gazed into it.</p> <p>At first, the people were fascinated. They crowded around the Spire, watching as its mirrors revealed their grievances in magnified form. A farmer might see a reflection of a drought that seemed eternal, though the skies had rained just the day before. A merchant might see a rival\u2019s success as insurmountable treachery, though it was merely fair competition.</p> <p>The Spire fed on their emotions, humming louder with every heated word and every clenched fist. It whispered back promises that were sweet to some and bitter to others: \u201cYou deserve more. They are taking it from you. Look at them\u2014don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p> <p>Soon, the Great Commons grew quiet. Few went there anymore, for the Spire offered easier answers. The kingdom fractured into camps, each believing the mirrors showed only their truth. They began to distrust not only each other but also the elders who once guided the kingdom with wisdom.</p> <p>From this chaos rose a figure called the Flamekeeper. He spoke loudly, with words that burned bright but gave little light. \u201cThe Spire is your ally,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cIt shows you what they are hiding. Trust in me, for I alone can douse the fires threatening our land!\u201d His voice echoed through the Spire, amplified and distorted until his followers heard not words, but prophecy.</p> <p>The Flamekeeper\u2019s words turned neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend. People abandoned their farms, their crafts, and their families to build shrines in his honor, convinced that loyalty to him would save them. Those who questioned the Flamekeeper were cast as villains, their images warped by the Spire into monstrous forms.</p> <p>The kingdom, once a place of shared purpose, became a wasteland of suspicion and anger. The rivers of trust dried up, and the mountains of wisdom crumbled under the weight of lies.</p> <p>Yet, amidst the turmoil, a small group of villagers remembered the Great Commons. They began to gather there again, away from the Spire\u2019s influence. They spoke not in shouts but in whispers, sharing their truths without mirrors to distort them. Slowly, they began to rebuild the bonds that the Spire had broken.</p> <p>Their task was daunting, for the Spire still stood, its whispers drawing crowds. But they knew that the only way to heal Ember Vale was to reject the illusions and rekindle the practice of listening, of questioning, of seeing each other not as reflections but as people.</p> <p>And so, they toiled in the shadow of the Spire, hoping that one day, the kingdom might remember the light that once united it, brighter than any flame.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/04/08/announcing-mockery-v3/","title":"Announcing Mockery v3","text":"<p>Mockery v3 will make obsolete all other interface-based code generation frameworks that currently exist in the Go community.

I bought a truck. Not just any truck, it's the truck to end all trucks. It's a truck so big that Chicago banned it.(1) Regardless, it's a truck that solves a lot of problems for me. It is on this rock that I will build my church.</p> <ol> <li>Yes really. Chicago outlawed C-plated trucks from parking on any residential street, including both paid and permitted parking. I ask myself every day why I still live in Chicago, but life is weird like that sometimes.</li> </ol> <p>Why did I decide I'm going to be a truck guy now? Well if you have read my blog at all, you know that I love to camp in the Rocky Mountains with my travel trailer. I used to tow it with my Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk (with a 5.7L Hemi mind you). It looked like this:</p> <ul> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> </ul> <p>The Trailhawk is an incredibly capable vehicle and has served me well over the last few years, but it has 4 main problems:</p> <ol> <li>It has airbags on the suspension. The airbags are great for off roading, but they will fail at some point, and when they fail, it's probably going to be in an extremely inconvenient location thousands of miles away from home.</li> <li>While it has the raw power to tow my trailer up and down mountain passes, it's not exactly a stable platform. You can feel the vehicle sway against the weight of the trailer. </li> <li>It has a very low payload capacity: roughly 1000 lbs. The fact that the trailer itself contributes 600 lbs to the Trailhawk, that leaves 400 lbs for me, my gear, and any passengers. It's not a lot, and I'm ashamed to say that the Jeep is almost always slightly overloaded by one or two hundred pounds.</li> <li>While it's a TRAIL Hawk, it's really only moderately good at off roading. At full airbag inflation, it only gives you about 11 inches of clearance. Not bad, but if I'm to do some of the more gnarly trails, it's not enough.</li> </ol> <p>Really the major problem with this platform was the low payload capacity and unstable riding characteristics when fully loaded. So... I bought a truck. A BIG truck. I bought a mutha fukin 2024 Ram 2500 Power Wagon baby.</p> <ul> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> </ul> <p>At the time I decided to pull the trigger on a truck, I was in the San Juan mountains of Colorado. My finances hit a major milestone and it felt like the right time, an appropriate time, to indulge in one. I found the exact model, color, and options I was looking for on autotrader.com, but unfortunately the only place that had what I was looking for was in eastern Kanses. I was 14 hours away from the dealership which is in fact a long time, but like all of my road trips, I just make an adventure of the drive itself.</p> <p>This thing is a beast. It's got both front and rear full locking differentials, a full time locking transfer case, a front disconnecting sway bar, lifted suspension, and tons of technology. Oh and of course a 6.4L Hemi. The other major detail I was looking for was a truck that came with a SmartCap bed cover. Those by themselves cost $5000 and dealerships usually don't consider the cost of add-ons when setting an asking price, so I essentially got it for free.</p> <p>With factory stock components, the truck has 14 inches of clearance, an approach angle of 34 degrees, a breakover angle of 23.2 degrees, and a departure angle of 24 degrees. I intend to install an aftermarket Carli Pintop suspension system and larger 35 inch tires which will give me an additional 2 inches of lift and additional 600lbs of payload (to bring it to 2000lbs) if options with the beefier R2 high capacity rear coils. The SmartCap bed cover also has mounting rails on the top which will allow me to add kayak mounts or even a roof top tent for overlanding.</p> <p>The possibilities are enormous and I'm super stoked to see where this will take me. And if you're wondering about the Trailhawk, don't worry. I still have her. It's getting shipped back to Chicago and will remain as my city vehicle that I can actually fit in my garage. When I'm not camping, the Green Machine will have to stay with the trailer at the storage facility I keep it at.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/","title":"NVIDIA HGX Containers as a Service","text":"<p>This post explores how to create a multi-tenant Containers as a Service Kubernetes platform tailored for GPU-based workloads.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Disclaimer</p> <p>The views and opinions expressed in this blog are solely my own and do not reflect the views, opinions, or positions of my employer or any organization I am affiliated with.</p> <p>The core directive of most cloud companies is simple: get as many customers to rent your physical hardware as possible. The way in which this hardware gets exposed to customers can be thought of as a pyramid of increasing virtualization. </p> <p>This pyramid looks something like this:</p> <ol> <li>Bare metal clusters in a private, single-tenant network.</li> <li>Bare metal clusters in a shared, multi-tenant network.</li> <li>Virtual machines via a VMM like QEMU, cloud-hypervisor, firecracker etc.</li> <li>Containers as a Service</li> <li>Functions as a Service</li> </ol> <p>When you look at a company like AWS, most of these layers have specific product names:</p> <ol> <li>AWS Outpost</li> <li>AWS EC2 Metal</li> <li>AWS EC2 (vanilla)</li> <li>AWS Elastic Container Service</li> <li>AWS Lambda</li> </ol> <p>The last two in this list are interesting cases of what's called a \"serverless\" infrastructure. Instead of your customer getting access to an entire host operating system, whether that be through a bare-metal OS or a virtualized one, they provide only the container or the code itself to run. The customer does not care to manage OS versions, they don't want to wrangle systemd, they don't care how it gets run, only that it does get run somewhere. \"Serverless\" of course is a bit of a misnomer because the container or the function still has to run on a server somewhere, but the cloud company itself is the one that manages the complexity of managing the lifecycle of these compute resources in a transparent way.</p> <p>A Containers as a Service (CaaS) product, as with all cloud products, needs to be concerned about how to properly isolate tenancies. Historically speaking, a \"container\" refers to an OCI-compliant \"image\" that packages an executable, a rootFS, and any software dependencies the executable runs. This executable is run as a normal process on the host kernel with various security gates around it, such as cgroups, network namespaces, filesystem mount namespaces (similar in a way to a chroot), PID namespaces, etc. that all serve to isolate this process from others.<sup>1</sup> This is a pretty good level of isolation for some use-cases, but astute readers may notice that there is a huge vector of attack: the kernel itself. The Linux kernel has been known to have major security vulnerabilities, some of which have allowed container escapes. Of course the kernel doesn't comprise of just the kernel itself, but also all kernel-mode drivers (KMD) that is either part of mainline linux or loaded as third-party kernel modules. Any of these drivers and modules can be vectors for abuse, so therefore they cannot be used to handle multiple different tenancies.</p> <p>If you don't want to share tenancies, what do you do? Well, each tenancy runs in its own VM of course. From the context of a CaaS product, there are a few different ways you can run containers inside of VMs. You can create a bespoke control plane that accepts a container, spins up a VM on a host, and runs that container inside of the VM (that kinda sounds like k8s doesn't it?). You could rely on one of the various OCI container runtimes that virtualize a kernel for the container process to use.<sup>2</sup> If you don't like reinventing the wheel, you can use a combination of open-source projects like Kubernetes for your control plane and Kata containers for your container runtime.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>Before designing our system, let's deploy our requirements onto pen and paper (or, uh, HTML and CSS):</p> <ol> <li>Host multiple different tenancies on a single server.</li> <li>Host multiple different tenancies on a single network fabric.</li> <li>Provide access to anywhere from 1 to 8 GPUs to a single container process.</li> <li>Provide access to networked storage via NFS.</li> <li>Containers should boot in a \"reasonable\" time (a couple of minutes max).</li> </ol> <p>Let's also call out an explicit non-requirement: containers will not have access to a high-performance fabric like Infiniband.

This complicates our k8s install quite substantially because it means we cannot use the niceties of the NVIDIA GPU Operator that do various useful things like announcing GPUs to Kubernetes, managing firmware versions, publishing DCGM metrics, establishing RDMA transactions etc. This means that without custom work, Kubernetes will be completely blind to the presence of these GPUs.<sup>3</sup></p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#cdi-device-plugin","title":"CDI Device Plugin","text":"<p>Kubernetes has a method for exposing the presence of resources through this thing called the Container Device Interface (CDI).

There is another OCI-compliant runtime called Kata Containers that can be exposed to containerd using config like this:</p> /etc/containerd/config.toml<pre><code>[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.kata-qemu-nvidia-gpu]\nruntime_type = \"io.containerd.kata-qemu-nvidia-gpu.v2\"\nruntime_path = \"/opt/kata/bin/containerd-shim-kata-v2\"\nprivileged_without_host_devices = true\npod_annotations = [\"io.katacontainers.*\"]\n\n[plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.kata-qemu-nvidia-gpu.options]\nConfigPath = \"/opt/kata/share/defaults/kata-containers/configuration-qemu-nvidia-gpu.toml\"\n</code></pre> <p>containerd also needs to expose the CRI interface (by default, it doesn't):</p> Text Only<pre><code># ctr plugins ls |&amp; grep cri\nio.containerd.grpc.v1                  cri                      linux/amd64    ok  \n</code></pre> <p>Now, when a Pod or Daemonset or other such deployable unit is marked with:</p> YAML<pre><code>spec:\n  runtimeClassName: kata-qemu-nvidia-gpu\n</code></pre> <p>The kubelet will request that containerd use this runtime instead of the default. When we launch a container through k8s with this runtime, we can see the interesting bits in the OCI spec using a command like <code>crictl inspect 6da11814ac01e</code>:</p> JSON<pre><code>{\n  \"info\": {\n    \"config\": {\n      \"CDI_devices\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"nvidia.com/gpu=6\"\n        }\n      ],\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>=6</code> specifies the specific name of the GPU.

Whe containerd calls out to the Kata shim <code>/opt/kata/bin/containerd-shim-kata-v2</code>, the shim performs these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Boot up a QEMU VM with a pre-defined VM image.</li> <li>Create a VSOCK port for that VM.</li> <li>Wait for the Kata agent inside of the VM to boot.</li> <li>Communicate through VSOCK with the kata-agent, request the kata-agent to run the container using a normal <code>runc</code> runtime.</li> <li>Stream results back to containerd.</li> </ol> <p>The idea itself is simple: run the container inside of a VM and go on with your day. Of course reality is more complicated than this. Recall that our requirement states that the VM should boot in a couple of minutes at most. This is simple for VMs that have no interesting devices being enumerated on the PCIe bus, but these large H100 GPUs with large BARs can be a real bear to the boot process. Not only do we need to now manage NVIDIA kernel driver versions, but we need to ensure that PCIe enumeration does not take a long time. When the kernel boots, the PCI subsystem walks the device tree and maps each BAR into virtual address space. i.e., it sets up page table mappings so that drivers can access device memory through MMIO. For large BARs (like the 64GB for H100s), this mapping step involves creating a lot more 4KB page entries which can noticeably slow down the early init process.</p> <p>One of the main ways to speed up VM boot processes, besides PCIe enumeration considerations, is to wrangle systemd. MicroVMs like those which are running container workloads probably don't need the systemd init system, and in fact NVIDIA created their own replacement to it called NVRC. NVRC does a lot of things that systemd does but without all of the ceremony. This includes things like:</p> <ol> <li>Spinning up daemons.</li> <li>Configuring syslog.</li> <li>Interacting with devices on PCIe.</li> <li>Managing system users.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#what-about-gvisor","title":"What about gVisor?","text":"<p>gVisor is one of the closest competitors to Kata Containers, and its implementation is really interesting. Instead of creating a virtualized kernel, gVisor instead runs the container process on the host kernel while intercepting all system calls the process makes. Most of the syscalls are served directly by gVisor, and the ones it can't will be handed off to the host kernel. In this way, gVisor acts as a sort of pseudo-virtual kernel. It's not a VM, it's not purely a syscall filter, nor is it an enhanced <code>runc</code>. It's something entirely different.</p> <p></p> <p>While this implementation is compelling, gVisor has a major flaw. Let's look at the quote in their documentation for GPU support:</p> <p>gVisor supports a wide range of CUDA workloads, including PyTorch and various generative models like LLMs. Check out this blog post about running Stable Diffusion with gVisor. gVisor also supports Vulkan and NVENC/NVDEC workloads. gVisor undergoes continuous tests to ensure this functionality remains robust. Real-world usage of gVisor across different GPU workloads helps discover and address potential compatibility or performance issues in nvproxy.</p> <p>nvproxy is a passthrough driver that forwards ioctl(2) calls made to NVIDIA devices by the containerized application directly to the host NVIDIA driver. This forwarding is straightforward: ioctl parameters are copied from the application\u2019s address space to the sentry\u2019s address space, and then a host ioctl syscall is made. ioctls are passed through with minimal intervention; nvproxy does not emulate NVIDIA kernel-mode driver (KMD) logic. This design translates to minimal overhead for GPU operations, ensuring that GPU bound workloads experience negligible performance impact.</p> <p>However, the presence of pointers and file descriptors within some ioctl structs forces nvproxy to perform appropriate translations. This requires nvproxy to be aware of the KMD\u2019s ABI, specifically the layout of ioctl structs. The challenge is compounded by the lack of ABI stability guarantees in NVIDIA\u2019s KMD, meaning ioctl definitions can change arbitrarily between releases. While the NVIDIA installer ensures matching KMD and user-mode driver (UMD) component versions, a single gVisor version might be used with multiple NVIDIA drivers. As a result, nvproxy must understand the ABI for each supported driver version, necessitating internal versioning logic for ioctls.</p> <p>As a result, nvproxy has the following limitations:</p> <ul> <li>Supports selected GPU models.  </li> <li>Supports selected NVIDIA driver versions.  </li> <li>Supports selected NVIDIA driver capabilities.  </li> <li>Supports selected NVIDIA device files.  </li> <li>Supports selected ioctls on each device file.  </li> <li>Supports selected platforms.  </li> </ul> <p>The TL;DR of it is that gVisor intercepts <code>ioctl</code> syscalls bound for the GPUs and performs a series of memory translations from the container's memory space to the kernel memory space due to the presence of file descriptors and pointers used in the struct passed to <code>ioctl</code>. Consequently, it needs explicit understanding of the NVIDIA driver ABI; simply copying the struct is not sufficient. The NVIDIA ABI is not stable across versions, which means that gVisor must updated with new struct definitions every time a new driver is released. This is a serious flaw, as it means support for newer generations of hardware is going to be gated behind gVisor's development team deciding when and where they want to support things. That is systemically dangerous as it hamstrings you behind whatever business decisions gVisor (and by extension Google itself) makes. Kata's approach of using the KMDs published by NVIDIA directly will never have this problem because NVIDIA will never release hardware without the appropriate drivers.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#nvlink-isolation","title":"NVLink Isolation","text":"<p>One of the core components of NVIDIA DGX or HGX systems is the presence of an all-to-all GPU interconnect called NVLink.

Because we're virtualizing our tenancies and removing NVIDIA kernel drivers from the host, we need to also run nv-fabricmanager inside of a VM.

Minute (or even major) differences in hardware can cause real problems when you're dealing with virtualization because the physical way in which components are connected can dramatically differ.

Cilium will determine whether or not the packet is allowed to continue based on however you've configured the CiliumNetworkPolicy.

Another method is to create a CRD that represents a GPU lease. In this scenario, a GPU lease will be granted before a specific job has been run but after it has been scheduled. The GPU lease controller will watch for leases that have a pod in some completed state, schedule a firmware check, then remove the lease (which may trigger its own post-lease finalizers) or transition the lease back to some <code>Free</code> state. The GPU CDI device plugin would need explicit awareness of leases so that it does not hand out a GPU that still has an active lease on it.</p> <p>Both of these methods are functionally similar, but a GPU Lease, which may be cluster-scoped instead of namespace-scoped (as in the finalizer idea) are more robust from a security standpoint (because the tenant does not own it) and more flexible as it allows us to create more a comprehensive and flexible state machine.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#putting-the-pieces-together","title":"Putting the Pieces Together","text":"<p>We've talked a lot about all the individual components, but let's put them together into a cohesive story.</p> <pre><code>flowchart TD\n    ExternalUser\n\n    subgraph ControlPlane\n        TenancyController\n        GPULeaseController\n        k8sAPIServer\n        CaaSAPIServer\n\n        CaaSAPIServer -- 2\\.

In my testing, I found that attempting to spawn multi-GPU Kata VMs was very difficult. A single-GPU VM on my system took about 2 minutes to spawn, most of that time seemingly spent on various bookkeeping steps after the GPU is ACPI hot-plugged, things like PCIe enumeration, device BAR mapping, NVIDIA driver initialization. These are the same concerns I noted above. I found that attempting to mount 8 GPUs was so slow in fact that Kubernetes eventually determined that the pod launch failed, eventually killing the VM and causing it to get into a crash loop. After aggressively increasing the various timeouts involved with pod launches, I found the VMs took around 30 minutes in the 8 GPU case. I brought this up to the Kata maintainers and they seemed surprised, noting that their launches took far less time.</p> <p>Some sleuthing suggests that a lot of this performance issue comes from the way the hypervisor maps the guest-physical memory addresses to host-physical memory addresses. These mappings appear to happen in 4 KiB chunks, which of course would turn into a huge number of mappings that need to be created for just a single GPU. This is an area of further investigation.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/10/21/gpu-based-containers-as-a-service/#my-impressions","title":"My Impressions","text":"<p>Broadening our scope of thinking beyond just \"how do I build GPU CaaS\", we ask ourselves \"why build GPU CaaS\"? There is a ton of complexity being introduced when we involve virtualization which means the maintenance burden is higher than a bare-metal deployment. It will also be true that Kata support for newer generations of hardware will always lag by some amount regardless of how diligent its developers are, especially considering the fact that there are multiple manufacturers of these HGX systems whose hardware differences must all be accounted for.</p> <p>After using Kata for a number of months, my general impression of it is that its support for GPU workloads is still young. It works well in the full-passthrough model, and especially so on systems without an NVLink fabric (because the complexities involved in the fabricmanager disappear), but more complex superpod systems like ones with NVLink fabrics were more difficult to do correctly. This is not a fault of the talented people working on the project. Instead, it's a timing problem. Kata only started to support GPU passthrough about a year ago, so it hasn't had enough time to thoroughly iron out all of the creases that arise with every permutation of hardware. The Kata developers are making rapid progress however, so I have no doubt that a lot of these issues will resolve themselves.</p> <p>The industry in general tends to favor large, monolithic, single-tenancy deployments for the latest generations of hardware. This is especially evident when you look at companies like Coreweave who are almost completely disinterested in servicing contracts less than a billion dollars. CaaS's place in the world seems to neatly fit into non-bleeding-edge generations of hardware. It's a recycling mechanism for businesses needing to continue to extract profits out of old hardware.</p> <p>The other thing to realize is that the world's AI-fueled GPU craze is very new, like only a few years old. As this craze continues to propagate and entrench itself, greater focus is going to be paid to making AI developer's lives easier. Serverless compute is the way of the future, and there is much engineering work to be done to bring this reality to fruition.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In fact, this is why OCI containers intrinsically rely on the Linux kernel because all of these features are Linux features, and is why containers running in MacOS or Windows require a Linux Virtual Machine. That's not to say there couldn't be a runtime that works in MacOS and Windows natively, but it would require exact feature parity and also risks containers behaving differently on different OSs, which is bad.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The two interesting competitors here are gVisor and Kata Containers.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Technically speaking, NVIDIA does provide a way to run sandboxed workloads using Kata containers, but in the author's experience, this path is extremely fraught with pitfalls, bugs, and in general seems to be poorly supported. They even call this out that using GIf you're a company and want to make the most money possible, you view these shortcomings of CaaS in the context of the broader lifecycle of NVIDIA hardware. Cutting edge systems will normally be acquired by large mega corporations who are willing to shell out gobs of money for private deployments, which usually means single tenancy (for the most part) and no virtualization needed. Certainly there will be no real need to partition servers themselves. Maybe you'd want to partition the cluster itself in various ways, but there's no benefit to slicing down servers beyond their 8x GPUs. So this begs the question: what happens when the cutting edge hardware depreciates and the mega corporations want to move onto a newer generation? Well, you can recycle this now neglected hardware into the public domain; give smaller companies with smaller budges smaller slices of it. That indeed is where CaaS shines.

To do this, we should look for some kind of pattern in how preorder/inorder traversals work. Let's remind ourselves of what preorder/inorder is:</p> <p>Preorder: This first visits the current node, then it recurses into the left child, then into the right child.</p> <p>Inorder: First it recurses into the left child, then it visits the current node, then recurses into the right child.</p> <p>What we can guarantee is that a preorder traversal will always start with the root node. An in-order traversal will always give us the left-most node first. So we can do the simple part of first defining the root node:</p> Python<pre><code>class Solution:\n    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -&gt; Optional[TreeNode]:\n        root = TreeNode(val=preorder[0])\n</code></pre> <p>The next node in the preorder traversal is going to be the immediate left child (if it exists), then the right node (if it exists).

Then the traversals would look like this:</p> Text Only<pre><code>preorder: [3, 20, 15, 7]\ninorder: [3, 15, 20, 7]\n</code></pre> <p>How do we know that <code>20</code> is a direct child of <code>3</code>? It would have to satisfy the conditions:</p> <ol> <li><code>20</code> would need to occur right of <code>3</code> in the in-order traversal</li> <li><code>20</code> needs to occur at a location that is exactly \\(i+n\\) away from <code>3</code> in the preorder traversal, where \\(i\\) is the index of <code>3</code> in the preorder list, and \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the left subtree. We can find \\(n\\) by subtracting the index of <code>3</code> in the in-order list from the index of <code>9</code> in the in-order list. We can hand-check this math in example 1: \\(i=0\\) and \\(n=3-1=2\\). We find that at index \\(2\\) in the pre-order list, we indeed find the value <code>20</code>.</li> </ol> <p>Let's first create a naive implementation of this, just to check that our logic is sound. I fully expect that the runtime will be horrid, but that's okay for a proof of concept. Let's start with the simple case of populating the left subtree:</p> Python<pre><code>class Solution:\n    def buildTree(\n        self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]\n    ) -&gt; Optional[TreeNode]:\n        if len(preorder) == 0:\n            return None\n\n        root = TreeNode(val=preorder[0])\n        if len(preorder) == 1:\n            return root\n\n        # Need to check if the next element in preorder is in the left subtree or the right\n        rootInorderIdx = inorder.index(preorder[0])\n        nextInorderIdx = inorder.index(preorder[1])\n\n        if nextInorderIdx &lt; rootInorderIdx:\n            # We need to find the ending preorder index to pass to the bottom function.

Then, we know that the next element of <code>preorder</code> is going to be a direct left descendent if and only if that next element appears to the left in the inorder array. So, we do some simple checks to ensure this is true.</p> <p>We run the code to see what happens and ensure that we receive the nodes <code>[3, 9]</code> in the output. Note, that this is obviously not the correct answer, but it will prove to us that the left subtree logic is working.

The right child is going to be the _first_ element we encounter in preorder, starting\n        #    from the root node and iterating right, that appears in the set we found in step 1.\n\n        rightSubtree = inorder[inorder.index(root.val) + 1 :] # (1)\n        rightChild = None\n        rightChildIdx = None\n\n        for idx, elem in enumerate(preorder[1:]): # (2)\n            if elem in rightSubtree:\n                rightChild = elem\n                rightChildIdx = (\n                    idx + 1\n                )  # it's +1 because we've excluded the first element (which is the root)\n                break\n        if rightChild: # (3)\n            root.right = self.buildTree(\n                preorder=preorder[rightChildIdx:], # (4)\n                inorder=rightSubtree,\n                depth=depth + 1,\n            )\n\n        return root\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li>In order to get the right subtree from the inorder traversal, we need to find the index of the current root. The root is always <code>inorder[0]</code> (or <code>root.val</code>, equivalently). So, we find the index that contains that value, and add one to it so we get the right subtree.</li> <li>The next step is to find what node is the right child of the root. To do this, we need have to skip over all of the nodes from the left subtree. The information on what nodes are in the left subtree is contained in the inorder list: everything to the left of <code>3</code> is the left subtree is the left, and everything to the right is the right subtree. We also know that the first element of the right subtree in the preorder traversal will be the root's direct descendent. So, loop over the values of preorder until we find the first right subtree element.</li> <li>It's possible we didn't find any right children.</li> <li>We now know the index of the new subtree's root, and the right subtree. Pass these values into the recursive function call.</li> </ol> <p>This solution passes the two test cases provided, so let's see if we get an accepted solution!</p> <p>Wrong Answer</p> <p>201 / 203 testcases passed</p> <p>This is not a bad result because we got the vast majority of the cases. Let's inspect one of the failing test cases.</p> Text Only<pre><code>Input\npreorder =\n[3,2,1,0,-1,-2]\ninorder =\n[3,2,1,0,-1,-2]\n\nOutput\n[3,null,2,null,1]\nExpected\n[3,null,2,null,1,null,0,null,-1,null,-2]\n</code></pre> <p>By constructing this tree by hand, we can tell that it's a tree with only right children. So why does the algorithm break after node <code>1</code>?</p> <p></p> <p>It turns out, I made a really stupid mistake. In line 54 above, I'm checking the truthiness of <code>rightChild</code> instead of checking that it's <code>not None</code>. This means that the integer <code>0</code> would evaluate to <code>False</code>, which isn't what I intended. After fixing this, this test case now passed. However, we run into another problem: the last test case times out.</p> <p>Our solution is doing some unoptimal things: we iterate over <code>preorder</code> and <code>inorder</code> multiple times linearly in various places. We can instead make use of sets to cut down on the \\(O(n^2)\\) operations we're doing (like for example in the cases where we're trying to determine the existence of a value in a particular subtree).</p> <p>Another unoptimal thing we're doing is making judicious use of <code>inorder.index</code> to find the index of an element.

The goal here is to find the number of ways we could combine the steps together (or not combine them) to reach the nth step.</p> <p>Let's take another example where <code>n=4</code>. The possible solutions are:</p> Text Only<pre><code>1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n2. 1 + 1 + 2\n3. 2 + 2\n4. 1 + 2 + 1\n5. 2 + 1 + 1\n</code></pre> <p>What about when <code>n=5</code>?</p> Text Only<pre><code>1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n2. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2\n3. 1 + 2 + 2\n4. 2 + 1 + 2\n5. 1 + 1 + 2 + 1\n6. 2 + 2 + 1\n7. 1 + 2 + 1 + 1\n8. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\n</code></pre> <p>Another way to look at this problem is in the links between the steps. Every flight of stairs will have <code>n-1</code> links in them. We can model combining the links together through an array. Take for example <code>n=5</code> above:</p> Text Only<pre><code>| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n</code></pre> <p>This array represents whether a pair of steps have been linked together,  where <code>0</code> means \"not linked\" and <code>1</code> equals \"linked\". We can iterate through the possible ways these can be linked together. Note that in this model, we can't have two <code>1</code>s directly adjacent to each other because that would mean we would have skipped over more than two steps at once. Going back to <code>n=5</code>, let's see the ways in which this can be done:</p> Text Only<pre><code>| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | # 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | # 1 + 1 + 1 + (1+1)\n\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | #  1 + (1+1) + (1+1)\n\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | # (1+1) + 1 + (1+1)\n\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | # 1 + 1 + (1+1) + 1\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | # (1+1) + (1+1) + 1\n\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | # 1 + (1+1) + 1 + 1\n\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | # (1+1) + 1 + 1 + 1\n</code></pre> <p>To confirm the idea that the 1's can't be adjacent, let's try the <code>n=4</code> example:</p> Text Only<pre><code>| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n| 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\n\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\n</code></pre> <p>This also checks out. The other pattern to note is that when we set a specific bit to 1, we've created a subproblem where we need to figure out how many combinations in the rest of the array we can have. Let's go back to the example of <code>n=5</code>, specifically this combination:</p> Text Only<pre><code>| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n</code></pre> <p>The subproblem is to figure out which of the remaining bits can be 1.

We keep track of the current level we're iterating at, and because we're iterating over the levels from left to right, we simply add each element to the end of the <code>nodes</code> list. When we've entered into a new level, we append a new element onto our list. Within a level, this will continue to overwrite the previous value such that only the rightmost value will not be overwritten.
